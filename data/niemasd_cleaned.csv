Good luck!!
Oof yeah that sounds way better 😂
The course on @Codecademy !
Gzipped TSVs so I can easily zcat -> cut -> sort/uniq/sed/tr/etc. easily to come up with summary statistics quickly from the command line. Plus
Thanks!!
Thanks
Thanks man!! Come visit SD!
Thank you!
Hahahaha no worries
Thank you!!
Thanks man :') dude I'm teaching SPIS this year
Thank you
Thank you!!
Found out I was awarded the first grant of my academic career earlier today 😄😄😄😄😄😄
Awesome! I think I'll order one then!
I'm looking at your other pics and I wanna grab one! I remember hearing a while back that unofficial docks were frying Switches because of the charger. Has that stuff been resolved now? Any worry about potential brick with this one?
No LTT plots?
Something I've been doing to simplify a complex plot is to first present the axes with nothing plotted and describe
That was super baller
I graduated before either of my PhD advisors made Twitters 😭😭😭 but they were both amazing and I am so grateful for both of their mentorship
I would imagine the UCs and Stanford would be good places to look! I'm at @UCSanDiego
Had my music on shuffle
Congrats! @mike_schatz is awesome!
Actually
I think Mendeley has the shared project library feature
That's good to know! What made you transfer
I personally really like Mendeley. Lots of people seem to be switching to Zotero
Make sure your working style fits with that of your potential advisor! Some people prefer a lot of structure
I think they replaced it with Microsoft Edge a few years back
Just skimmed the git2rdata website
How large are the data? Doesn't GitHub explicitly want users to not do this? Or does it utilize GitHub LFS?
Sounds like a great use-case for @stepikorg
+1 for learning to code on @Raspberry_Pi and other low-cost options. Plus
What's a research question you find interesting and how would you approach investigating it?
"Correct: """"high quality"""" has unlimited storage"
Thank you!! :)
Thank you!!
Thanks man!!
Hahaha thanks man!!
Thank you!!!
Thanks bro!!! :')
I saw your book at @BNBuzz and it was awesome seeing a book written by someone I know! Awesome work Sarah!!
Welcome to @UCSanDiego!!
"This reminds me of the South Park episode about ISPs. """"Oh geez we'd LOVE to help"""" 😂 I agree that """"trying"""" sounds like a cop-out without a specific definition of what exactly """"try"""" actually means"
Ah yup
Why not have an HTTP server running on the machine (e.g. the simple one built into Python) so you can just point to the report's URL
Payment for non-printed supplement? That makes no sense to me
Thank you!!
Thank you! :-)
Sounds great
For saves
Thank you!!!
Thanks!!!!
♥️♥️♥️ making us proud :')
I feel forgotten 😭
YOU GOT THIS BROBEANS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Welcome to San Diego! @Scripps_Ocean is great! I used to work in a lab there
By performance
I use IQ-TREE when I can
Woops
Woops
Luckily
Ah good to know
I'm letting it air-dry upside down on some paper towels for a day
Water just spilled on my MacBook Air in the midst of making my thesis defense slides 😭😭😭 This is the stuff of nightmares
Yeah I totally feel that! I know X-plore has a Sort by Size feature
"Is anyone able to build images on #DockerHub right now? My builds have been stuck in """"Pending"""" for like 3 hours now. Last time I built an image was ~6 months ago"
I love that my Bioinformatics research is all done remotely from the comfort of my apartment
Lmao no worries brobeans!
Dissertation-writing has killed all of my self control. I got TapEx like 3 times in the past week 😂
I'll be starting as an Assistant Teaching Professor this Fall and would love to collaborate! Not looking for a job
Also
Ah yeah
Any way to automate the sequence of programs
The Twitter account says this
Trick question: @Jens_Luebeck is a bot
Gonna miss you
That would be great! I've been meaning to meet with @jeetsukumaran
Thank you!!
Thank you!!

Forgot to spread this to my Twitterverse
Beware that the legality of DRM removal is a somewhat grey area (even if for personal use and not for distribution)
*ISCB :-)
Sounds like this should be your side hustle 😂😂
Just contributed! :-)
Welcome to @ucsdbe! It's an excellent department!
That's true
Congrats and welcome!
😂😂
When you're trying to learn about the Kendall rank correlation coefficient
Hahahaha I agree
Yeah I don't understand this era of clickbait hype. Sometimes the paper on the other end of the overhyped tweet/article is actually pretty interesting
@erfansayyari We should get the Mirarab Lab to have an outing like this 😂
Any reason why you recommend deploying on a webserver/localhost instead of just using GitHub Pages? I remember the last exploit worked from GitHub Pages
Congrats on the nomination
Most of my tools primarily involve tree traversal algorithms that include a sense of time or distance
That's awesome!!
Check out the Bioinformatics booth set up by @UCSanDiego Bioinformatics graduate and undergraduate students!
Glad to hear it :-)
🔥🔥🔥
Okay that's good
My thoughts (or at least hopes) exactly :-)
For my main PhD project
Glad you figured it out :-)
HINT: Because rand is sampling uniformly between 0 and RAND_MAX
The flipCoin function can only return 1 or 0
LOL curse you hachimoji!!
Definitely true! The proper visualization choice depends on the dataset and the context
I personally prefer violin plots
Literally what I'm doing right now 😂😂
While submitting a Letter of Recommendation for a Business Analytics M.S. program
That's true! I want to clarify that
The Graduate Bioinformatics Council (GBIC) has one that isn't really used (@gbicucsd)
If I'm writing in @googledocs
I think all projects that aren't restricted for some reason should be on GitHub. Even projects that do have privacy restrictions
I personally like the idea of showing all code (if it's not for a private project). If a coder has the ability to know when their code is unrefined
"Also """"I reinvented the FASTA-parsing wheel incorrectly"""" bugs"
Briefly skimming a potential interviewee's @github  repo is my favorite! If they don't have one
It's working for me as well
Was @Wolfram_Alpha able to help? That's what I use to see if a series converges and whatnot (pretty much any equation stuff I do lol)
I'd definitely recommend getting on the @salkinstitute SalkEducation email list! I've volunteered quite a bit through them
Great! Sending you an email right now. Thanks!
Also
Interesting. I imagine you would need to show positive preliminary results to successfully apply for grants to pay for data access; have you found the small public datasets to give you strong enough statistical power for that?
I'm a Bioinformatics Ph.D. candidate at UCSD (focus on algorithms)
Congrats!!
These look awesome
Good luck!!!
Not a movie
I totally forgot about Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom with all the Pokemon/Smash/etc. hype! It's back on the top of my list!
It's pretty amazing! An added bonus is that you can have shared folders
Any reason why you don't use @mendeley_com? You can create folders
No problem! :-)
@FolkerMeyer
By the way
You got this!
We're unfortunately living in a time of click bait articles that don't actually contain any information 😑
Comic Sans 😱😱
@overleaf has been great for me!
This is absolutely horrifying. Why has @UCIrvine not addressed this? I haven't seen any public comments about this; am I missing something?
I also found the PDF because I wanted to know what exactly he was referencing in the letter
I was premed until my senior year of undergrad
"Or rasterizing vector graphics in your figures 🙃 """"Low-resolution figures"""" is a reviewer comment I've received multiple times"
That would make sense! If you make a single master spreadsheet yourself
Totally unrelated

Hahaha but we really should! I work a lot with Christine Alvarado
Wait
Wow
Interesting
But I really like that LeanPub can export an actual ebook file. Did you all have to do anything manual for that
Wanna chat after the talks tonight? I just skimmed your course on my phone
I haven't played with @leanpub though
I met him briefly
@nmmsv You're famous!
Just landed at JFK
I agree! Sorry for the delayed response to your email
I usually have a JSON or CSV with metadata
Actually
(or if @overleaf had a permalink to the current version PDF in a given repo ❤️❤️)
"That makes sense! I guess I would just like a clean way of having compiled PDFs (at least a """"master version"""") that is automatically updated at the same URL. Maybe CI will end up being the best option in the end"
I have a @github repository linked to an @overleaf project
Day 4 of trying to get the LaTeX source of my manuscript
I mean you can easily do it in 1 line of actual code and 2 import lines in Python if you wanted to...?  from seaborn import lmplot from pandas import read_csv lmplot(x='x'
Yes
😂😂
Ah
Yes it can
"No worries! My solution for the time being is to just create a """"Current"""" folder so it's easy for me to see just what I'm actively working on by going there. Multiple folders per document helps me keep them organized nicely. Thanks for the excellent product :-)"

I feel like people don't usually tweet about Bioinformatics tools unless they're complaining about them though
Awesome
I didn't investigate too deeply
Would you be interested in collaborating to build a series of online auto-graded coding challenges to accompany your course
Ah
Ah
What's the benefit of this over simply using Google Docs to write/share the document? Genuinely interested as this is pretty cool!
I'm at UCSD working on phylogenetics! Would be very interested in potential collaborations (as well as to show you around if you're new to the area)!
I think AI would be more appropriate for that
What are you interested in? I think it's important to decide what types of problems excite you the most
Ah interesting
Only like 800 episodes to go 😂😂
You should check out the @stepikorg platform! Auto-graded coding challenges/quizzes/activities embedded directly within content delivery
Also be sure to check out @stepikorg ! We develop all of our course content on there. Auto-graded code challenges that can be solved directly in the web browser/app
Perhaps it's a tactic to divert attention away from the morning's self-incriminating tweet
@air_caudal you in high school lmao
"Really? That's strange. I thought most journals had a """"View Metrics"""" button on each paper that uses @altmetric to provide these data (at least # of PDF downloads). I know @systbiol and @biorxivpreprint definitely do off the top of my head"
Right

Nevertheless
No worries! I avoid making copies to keep things fast/simple for users to modify
What would you like to use to access the node? I.e.
You could do something like:  mrca = tree.mrca(nodes) mrca.label = my_label  mrca() returns the node itself

@mybinderteam This seems really cool! Just curious: if the developer has the Dockerfile already
Great
I work with Pavel Pevzner and @PhillipCompeau on innovative online Bioinformatics/CS education. Would an abstract about that work be appropriate for the conference? I also have algorithmic research in phylogenetics that I could submit if not
I'm sorry
It took me a long time to even interpret what was going on 😂 they could have so easily just plotted 3 kernel density estimates and made such a clean figure
Finally made it to Tokyo
Sounds good!
I'm leaving for Tokyo tomorrow and will get there around 3:45 PM their time! We should meet up after conference registration!
Any other algorithm problems at hand? I might be able to help lol I wrote a textbook on data structures
Not quite papers

The file extension was .js and there were some other things I wanted to clean up. I've created a Pull Request on the GitHub repo with my fixes/cleanups
Why not create a GitHub Pages site to host it automatically from the GitHub repo? I created a pull request (requires a .nojekyll file to create properly)
