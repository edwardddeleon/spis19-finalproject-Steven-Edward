nothing is true anymore 🎶
Non c’est juste mon écoute du matin mais j’aimerais trop
woaaaaaaah
Omg yes now you can spend those 99 cents buying Dream Dream Dream on iTunes <3
Omg yes now you can spend those 99 cents buying All My Friends on iTunes <3
Thanks for the idea - added!
Limited first batch! Let me know what you’d like us to make next ✨
c’est une rediffusion du premier épisode j’y avais pas pensé 😭
Thanks haha I saw some people really didn’t get/like it so figured I would clarify this is an intentional look lol
Fwiw this was professionally styled and groomed
That Phoenix one is so so special. I’ve noticed all my favorite album art upset me at first (TLOP comes to mind)
Shelter was three years ago and I kinda loved being in a band - that was cool ⚡️⚡️
sososo badass - what material is the back??
I’m also checking out original music at : goodfaithera+music@gmail.com
If you’ve made a remix or covered a song or created anything Madeon-related you’re proud of that you want me to check out and promote
Ok yes it didn’t occur to me people would see this as a short-term brief they have to act on. If you’ve followed my show you’ll see it’s not the spirit of it at all. Deleted that tweet -
But also how do you feel about remix contests ? They made my career
There’s been too many submissions and i’m trying to filter out a subset by only taking more targeted creations. The line is fine though. Fwiw I pay everybody upfront on all commissioned work
That’s kind of exactly what this is though
It’s about parenthood and transmission in general!
Email me about your favorite live recording (taken from a live album) and tell me why you love it : goodfaithera+specialsong@gmail.com Submissions end in 20 hours !
Limited tix for early shows were kept for the onsale yes

I’m on my way to rehearsal for Good Faith Live. I’m smiling nonstop thinking about this show honestly.
Je l’ai emprunté à mon styliste j’ai pas pu le garder 😭😭😭
People hit me up asking who the lead actor was
All good
Ah merci!! C'était du bricolage dans l'effervescence
Along the way there were moments when I wondered if you'd hear that music at all.  Now we're here!  Now it's not just mine but ours - and i'm very very glad! ⚡️
I'm reading all your messages about Dream Dream Dream keep them coming i'm so happy <3<3<3

WELCOME BACK wow!!
Behind the scenes i’ve been having one of the most intense and creative weeks of my life! I like making stuff ✨
Presale is sold out but there will be a handful of tickets available on Fri 10am !
I’ll look into this I think that’s all optional ! You can stop after giving basic infos and you’ll basically just get an email when presale starts.
That one was actually colored with my file
Vendredi 28
Let’s do it ⭐️
COMPLETELY NEW SHOW - Live show.
It’s neither! I know what the original line said but i’ll keep it a mystery 💫
Somewhere else
Likewise!! Porter and I were gushing side of stage about how cool your project and commitment to art direction is.
Thanks!! Yeaaah it does 😭  And yeah i’m the first embarassed haha
I know man we had some serious tech issues
WOW i didn’t realize and now i’m eating mine. Thank you this has been the most immediately useful tweet i’ve ever read.
Oh no i’m sorry!! We’ll have that shirt online soon ✨
We kept some for today but there’s not a lot!
No
I’m incredibly excited to play tonight

Yesss it’s difficult (but really interesting) to optimize color for print so they really pop
Thank you!! I’m glad you have one and like it :)
Do you have a photo ?!
cool move moving the seal to the top right
Hello this is now the official All My Friends music video thank you very much -
Sometimes a song has a destiny greater than itself ☀️
I really wanted to STREAM celebrate my varied AMF inspirations NOW ❤️
There's a lot of details i'm really proud of in the production you can hear better in the instrumental - have a listen!
A different one is coming up monday -
SPONTANEITY IS GOOD 🖼
Good times ✨
I made that one! ❤️
This comes from a larger project ✨
HAND MODELING : Hugo Leclercq
Merci ✨
PRODUCTION : Just me  HOPEFULLY I'M NOT RUINING THE THESIS OF YOUR VERY KIND ARTICLE.  I'm very thankful for anybody who has contributed something to it. And even if nobody else had been involved it would be unfair to take all the credit
WRITING : That's all me  MIXING : I had somebody else mix it (the amazing Tom Norris) but I ended up redoing it so I mixed/mastered the final EXCEPT the backing track in prechorus 1 and 2 which uses his mix.
BASS : The bass is a complex edited sauce featuring layered performances by me
HEY!!! So to be clear full super detailed credits on All My Friends :  Vocals :  - I'm singing all the vocals except 0:55
ALL COPIES HAVE BEEN FOUND.  “ALL MY FRIENDS” OUT EVERYWHERE FRIDAY.
New show
MADEON LIVE - Lollapalooza 2019
This looks extremely cool to me tbh
It’s a very rare legendary vintage unit used by Daft Punk and Kavinsky.
Like all my best jackets it’s thrifted!
Aaaaah thank you!! ✨
I don’t mind screenshots
I often delete my replies after a while not sure why 😭
No.
I love this!!!!!
