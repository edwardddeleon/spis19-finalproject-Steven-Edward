"Johnny Isakson has cast a bright beam in our nation’s Capitol. A man of rare integrity, unwavering honesty & profound character, his work has helped shape American greatness. His decision to retire from the Senate will dim the light of goodness he’s shed on it for so many years."
".@CindyMcCain and the McCain family have created a new way to honor John’s legacy by encouraging #ActsofCivility. John left this country and this world better off, and this is a wonderful way to keep his spirit and character alive."
"Today marks one year since the passing of John McCain. Courageous, honorable, driven by a duty to family, country & God, John exemplified the values we as Americans hold so dear. I'm blessed to have called him a friend. May we continue to be inspired by his heroism and character."

"The President’s praise for MBS, the man who US intel says ordered or authorized the heinous murder of a WaPo columnist & Saudi dissident, sends the wrong message to the world. It’s past time for Congress & the administration to impose sanctions for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi."

"The question that Congress wants answered is whether any senior Saudi officials, including members of the Saudi royal family, were responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. By law, the President is required to report to Congress on these findings & imposition of sanctions."

"Disgusting, vile threats and actions against fellow Americans and our institutions are sadly unsurprising: hate acts follow hate speech. It is past time for us to turn down and tune out the rabid rhetoric."
"America can't excuse & minimize the brutal & gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident & columnist. Our country is defined by human values, by principle above convenience, & by commitment to morality. We must subject the perpetrators of this outrage to withering sanction."
I hope and expect that Judge Kavanaugh's excellent record on the second highest court in the land will be matched by his work on the highest court in the land.
I support the decision to re-open the FBI background investigation into the allegations made by Dr. Ford. It is my earnest hope that this will help inform the Senate and ensure the integrity of the Supreme Court.

Prayers for the First Lady and for Harry Reid.  Hoping for healing and recovery for both.
"Robert Jeffress says “you can’t be saved by being a Jew,“ and “Mormonism is a heresy from the pit of hell.”  He’s said the same about Islam. Such a religious bigot should not be giving the prayer that opens the United States Embassy in Jerusalem."
"John McCain makes America great. Father, grandfather, Navy pilot, POW hero bound by honor, an incomparable and irrepressible statesman. Those who mock such greatness only humiliate themselves and their silent accomplices."
Thank you to all the delegates who hung in there with us all day at the Convention. I appreciate the support I received and look forward to the primary election.

"Putin today blames US politics for icy relations. Get real: It was Russia invading sovereign nations, propping up dictators, hacking elections, abusing human rights, and cheating at the Olympics."

"On this Veterans Day, let’s honor our servicemen and women and take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices they make to ensure our liberty."

"Follow the team:  @ZacMoffatt, @KevinMaddenDC, @LanheeChen, @EvanYost2012, @Ted_Newton, @KvnSheridan, @Alcivar, @AbeAdams, @AMHenneberg"
"During tonight's debate, follow the team: @RomneyResponse, @PaulRyanVP, @TeamRomney, @AndreaMSaul, @EricFehrn, @ggitcho"
"Agree with @JoeBiden, the middle class has been buried the last 4 years, which is why we need a change in November #CantAfford4More"
.@BarackObama has spent nearly 4 years implementing policies that have destroyed jobs. We can’t afford 4 more.
Another term for @BarackObama will only bring more of the same policies that have devastated the middle class.
Congrats to Brandt Snedeker on his win of the tour championship and FedEx Cup. He is a class act.
Economic freedom is the only force in history that has consistently lifted people out of poverty – and kept people out of poverty.
".@BarackObama promised to solve the housing crisis, but he's failed to make an impact & homeowners are still struggling."
Efforts that promote hard work and personal responsibility over government dependency make America strong.
"Instead of creating a web of dependency, I will pursue policies that grow our economy and lift Americans out of poverty."
"Candidate Obama's slogan in 2008 was ‘Yes, we can.’ His slogan now is ‘No, I can’t.’ It's time for a new president."
"The dreamers and the entrepreneurs, not government, built this economy, and they can once again make it strong."
I am running for president to get us creating wealth again – not to redistribute it.
I'll share my plan to create 12 million jobs and expand educational opportunities on @Univision tonight at 10pm ET
"We believe in free people & free enterprise, not redistribution. The right course is to create growth & wealth, not to redistribute wealth."
"Candidate @BarackObama promised to not pass our bills on to the next generation, yet he’s increased the debt by $5.4T"
"Your share in the national debt? Over $51,000 – an increase of over $16,000 under @BarackObama"
Hispanics aren't better off after 4 years of @BarackObama. Grateful to speak to @USHCC about how we'll lead where he has failed.
Ann and I extend our warmest wishes to the Jewish Community for a happy and peaceful year. L’Shanah Tovah.
"The House just passed the Stolen Valor Act, a bipartisan bill that defends the integrity of all those who have worn the uniform. Great job!"
"For nearly 4 years, @BarackObama has refused to crack down on China’s cheating & American workers have paid the price."
"On this most somber day, America is united under God in its quest for peace and freedom at home and across the world."
Congrats to the field team & volunteers for contacting over 20 million voters. More doors knocked on so far than in all of 2008!
"The President is required by law to tell the people how he would implement defense cuts, but chooses to ignore the deadline for doing so."
"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover. 43 straight months of unemployment above 8%. America deserves better."
"At the 2008 #DNC, @BarackObama promised Americans a better future, but it’s clear he hasn’t lived up to his promises."
"At the 2008 #DNC, @BarackObama criticized an economy with high unemployment, but today unemployment is even higher."
"At the 2008 #DNC, @BarackObama criticized an economy in “turmoil.”After 4 years of his leadership, it’s no better."
".@BarackObama doubled down on his “you didn’t build that” comments, demonstrating just how out of touch he is with small-business owners."
"When @BarackObama told Americans they didn’t build their businesses, it wasn’t just rhetoric – his record & policies show he meant it."
Today marks the 4th straight year America’s global economic competitiveness has been downgraded. #AreYouBetterOff
"Before @BarackObama took office, the U.S. ranked 1st in global competitiveness – today marks our 4th year of decline."
"Instead of delivering more jobs & higher incomes, @BarackObama’s policies have left the middle class in worse shape. #AreYouBetterOff"
Millions of Americans aren’t better off in the @BarackObama economy. Is it an “incomplete” or a failing grade? #AreYouBetterOff
".@BarackObama grades himself “incomplete” on the economy, but what happened to the “one-term proposition?”"
"If @BarackObama can’t even give himself a passing grade, why would the American people give him 4 more years?"
"$16T and counting. After promising to cut the deficit in half, @BarackObama has presided over four straight trillion-dollar deficits."
"We don't belong to government, the government belongs to us."
"Labor Day is a chance to celebrate the strong American work ethic, but too many Americans are worrying when their next paycheck will come."
#FF @Reince. Terrific #GOP2012 - excited for November 6th.
What a week here at #GOP2012. November 6th is around the corner – let's get to work. #BelieveInAmerica #RomneyRyan2012
"Our economy runs on freedom, not government. It’s time we put our faith back in the American people #BelieveInAmerica #RomneyRyan2012"
I’m running for president because I know my vision will help strengthen the middle class & restore America’s promise #BelieveInAmerica
Our Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will create 12 million new jobs & higher take-home pay #BelieveInAmerica #RomneyRyan2012
".@PaulRyanVP is a man of tremendous character, and I look forward to hearing him speak tonight #WeCanChangeIt #GOP2012"
We have 23 million Americans today that are out of work or underemployed #WeCanChangeIt #GOP2012
.@BarackObama looks at government as the source of our greatness. I look at the American people as the source of our greatness. #WeBuiltIt
.@BarackObama’s attempt to denigrate the achievement of the individual diminishes and divides us. #WeBuiltIt
The safety of those in Isaac's path is of the utmost importance. I applaud those in Tampa making appropriate schedule changes. #GOP2012
Neil Armstrong today takes his place in the hall of heroes. The moon will miss its first son of earth.
"In the imaginary recovery @BarackObama touts, manufacturing lost 562,000 jobs & the sector is showing signs of weakness."
I welcome the support of the delegates formerly pledged to @RickSantorum. Together we will take back the White House.
Incomes down sharply in the imaginary recovery @BarackObama touts. We can do better. 
Appreciate the support of the delegates formerly pledged to @NewtGingrich. Together we will defeat @BarackObama in November.
Congrats to my friend @CondoleezzaRice for joining Augusta National & congrats to Augusta National for admitting its first female members
Interesting that @BarackObama admits that he cut $716 billion from Medicare from current seniors to pay for Obamacare.
"If your priority is creating more jobs and putting more people to work, that's what we know how to do. #RomneyRyan2012"
Happy Birthday wishes to a great friend and Iowa's outstanding Lt. Gov. @KimReynoldsIA!
Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a blow to struggling middle-class families. Americans deserve better and we can do better.
#FF @AnnDRomney @TeamRomney @AndreaMSaul @DGJackson @LanheeChen @Rick_Gorka
Sally Ride ranks among the greatest of pioneers. I count myself among the millions of Americans she inspired with her travels to space.
.@AnnDRomney and I want to wish our good friend Bob Dole a Happy Birthday - 89 years young today!
Ann & I are deeply saddened by the news of the violence in CO. Praying for the loved ones of the victims during this time of immense grief.
Ron Paul’s “Audit The Fed” bill is a reminder of his tireless efforts to promote sound money and a more transparent Federal Reserve.
Tell @BarackObama entrepreneurs & innovators build successful businesses. Celebrate your success & share your photos using #YouDidBuildIt
My thoughts are with farmers and ranchers during this difficult time as widespread drought is gripping this country.
Ann & I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Alex Okrent. Prayers are with Alex’s loved ones and the entire Obama campaign team.
"Being president is not about telling stories. Being president is about leading, and President Obama has failed to lead."
Our thanks and support to @ScottBrownMA & @RepJoeHeck for proposing a new Stolen Valor Act to protect the honor of our military heroes.
The President's policies have not gotten America working again. He is going to have to stand up and take responsibility for that.
"With so many around the world still consigned to tyranny, today we appreciate the blessing of liberty & are thankful that we are Americans."
"68 yrs ago, the G.I. Bill became law. Today, we have a new Greatest Generation that has answered our country's call in the aftermath of 9/11"
#FF @DGJackson - great job last night on @RockCenterNBC.
"Thank you to those who stormed the beaches, took the cliffs and freed a continent. We should never forget #DDay"
Unemployment rate up. @BarackObama’s re-election slogan may be ‘forward’ but it seems like we've been moving backward. We can do better.
"#1144. Thank You. Whatever challenges lie ahead, we will settle for nothing less than getting America back on the path to prosperity."
Want to be one of the first to see our next TV ad tomorrow? Join our text messaging program - text DAY1 to 466488.
This election is about the 23m struggling to find work. @BarackObama refuses to accept moral responsibility for his failed policies.
"When all is said and done, there’s nothing more important than our families. I’ve been blessed with a wonderful one. Happy #MothersDay."
.@RickSantorum ran a spirited race & his commitment to conservatism energized millions of Republicans. Grateful for his endorsement.
A lot of Americans are having hard times & the unemployment report is not good news. This is not progress; it is very disappointing.

".@BarackObama is moving us away from our Founders’ vision. Instead of limited government, he is leading us toward limited freedom."
The incompetence from the Obama administration has emboldened the North Korean regime & undermined the security of the US & our allies.
".@BarackObama is the progress we've made the record high gas prices, skyrocketing foreclosures, or millions of Americans out of work?"
"What is truly shocking and disappointing is that the number of unemployed women has increased by 858,000 under @BarackObama’s watch."
"Senator Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran."
"My experience with Mike Wallace -- integrity, charm, character. A great one goes home."
"This Easter, we are thankful for our brave men and women in uniform who are serving our country & are away from their families."
Ann joins me in wishing everyone sitting down for a Passover Seder a joyous time with family and friends.
"Praying for a quick recovery for Bella. Ann and I are keeping Rick, Karen and the entire Santorum family in our thoughts."
This is a weak jobs report that shows the employment market remains stagnant. Americans are paying a high price for @BarackObama's policies.
Big thanks to everyone in MD and DC – what a way to start the night. Excited for WI results to start coming in.
America today has the highest business tax in the world and now @BarackObama wants a new global business tax. #ObamaLogic

.@SenRonJohnson experience as a successful manufacturer & job creator brought him to Washington in 2011 – proud to have his support.

Ann and I send our thoughts and prayers to Vice President Cheney for a fast and full recovery.
