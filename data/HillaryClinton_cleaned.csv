We should not nuke hurricanes.
"In the last 24 hours, the administration has announced:  - They will seek the power to detain migrant children indefinitely  - They won’t provide flu shots to families in detention  Six children have already died, three in part from the flu.  This is a recipe for more tragedy."

"With two mass shootings in America in less than 24 hours, thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need action.   The House has sent common-sense gun safety legislation to the Senate. Demand that @senatemajldr and your Republican elected officials join Democrats to pass it."
And they say you’re moderate.
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico as they protest the corruption and disgraceful behavior of their government. Like all Americans, they have the fundamental right—and duty—to hold their leaders to account."
"Democracy may be our birthright as Americans, but it’s not something we can ever take for granted.   Every generation has to fight for it.   After last night's Trump rally, it's clearer than ever that the time has come again."
"""It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law,"" John Paul Stevens once wrote. He was one of its finest stewards. My deepest condolences to his family and friends."
The Trump administration is preparing sweeping raids on undocumented people as the president threatens to go against the Supreme Court and demand citizenship information through the Census.   Weaponized fear and bigotry are the central projects of this administration.
"Diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection. It is the balancing of risk.   So far, the administration has consciously chosen a dangerous path leading to a riskier future. But diplomacy is still the only way for the administration to climb out of the hole they’ve dug."
"As I said after the Iran deal was reached, it was not perfect but it achieved its fundamental mission of blocking every pathway for Iran to get a bomb."
"By withdrawing from the deal, the administration has effectively broken up the international coalition that was unified in constraining Iran, and now Iran is once again increasing its nuclear capability."
"When the Trump administration threatened to pull out of the Iran deal and impose more sanctions last year, it was clear that we'd lose our leverage and Iran would be free to do what it wanted.   Predictably, Iran is now exceeding enrichment limits the deal once imposed."
"We need a strong national defense, but a president shouldn’t need it next to him in a parade to show his patriotism."
I'm grateful to the members of Congress who have visited camps at the border over the last couple of days to hold a light to the nightmarish conditions there.   We need more oversight. We need accountability. We need them now.
There's ample evidence that Republicans in office have pursued gerrymandered maps to shut out people of color from our political process. I'm disappointed but not surprised about today's anti-democratic decision.

"Amazing update: Together, we've raised over $500,000 in the past 48 hours for groups working to protect children at the border.   The Trump administration’s cruelty has caused a moral and humanitarian crisis for every American. Thank you for responding with compassion and action."
We can help these children get the help they deserve. And we can send a message to the administration that we won't stand for this. We just won’t. #CloseTheCamps
It's hard to process that our country is committing such abuses—and against children—in our name.   But let's not stop at outrage or heartbreak.
"I've been heartbroken and horrified to read the news of children at the border being detained in appalling conditions.   No soap, no toothbrushes, no beds.   Not enough food, babies being forced to take care of babies, everyone sick."
"Quick update, and great news: Legislators passed Rhode Island’s Reproductive Privacy Act and @GovRaimondo signed it into law last night!   It was a close vote, so thanks again to everyone who called, wrote, and visited their representatives to protect reproductive rights."

Happy #Juneteenth. Let's celebrate our victories and communities as we keep working for a more perfect union.
"On the one hand, the president makes nonstop outlandish claims in his recent @ABC interview about my campaign and Russia. On the other hand: Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, and the entire Mueller report."
"We lost my brother Tony last night. It’s hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today. When he walked into a room he’d light it up with laughter. He was kind, generous, & a wonderful husband to Megan & father to Zach, Simon, & Fiona. We’ll miss him very much."
"Eid Mubarak to all those celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan. May God grant peace, health, and prosperity."

"Happy Pride Month! Gay rights are human rights, now and forever. This administration's attacks on the LGBTQ+ community can never change that, and I'm proud to stand and fight with you to make sure those rights are recognized as they should be. 🌈"
"I'm disgusted by legislators' refusal to address the reality that this equipment needs to be regulated. We don’t need any more evidence that lives are at stake, and 12 more people just paid a terrible price for continuing inaction."
The president hasn't just refused to condemn a foreign power that attacked our democracy. He's also failed to protect the country's voting systems against future attacks. He betrays his oath every day.
I’m so honored to be giving the commencement at @Hunter_College today. See you this afternoon at MSG!

"Today marks one year since the administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy at the border.   Families were ripped apart with no plan to reunite them. Many are still waiting.   It is a defining failure of policy and humanity."

Let's be clear: This administration's dehumanization and cruelty toward migrants will not stop after Kirstjen Nielsen leaves office. It is their principal policy.
"Facts:  - Puerto Ricans are Americans. - Puerto Ricans have not received $91 billion in aid.  - Puerto Rico is still waiting for the help its government should provide as they rebuild after 3,000 deaths and horrific damage."
"Every single Senate Democrat has signed on as a co-sponsor of the #ForThePeople Act to fix our broken democracy.   Have Republican senators? Give them a call today and tell them you want automatic voter registration, early voting, and less money in politics: (202) 224-3121"
"Congratulations x2, Mini! Such wonderful news."
"What can we do?   Make sure your representatives are holding the administration accountable for this attack on our health care; organize to build political support for more coverage for more people.   Health care is a human right, and we can realize that right in America."
If Republicans prevail in court:  - 20 million people will lose coverage - Protections for pre-existing conditions will be gone - Young people won't be able to stay on their parents' plans until age 26 - Limits on coverage will return - Caps on out-of-pocket expenses will be gone
"The move is a dramatic escalation on the attacks on Obamacare in the courts, even for the Trump administration. Under Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department had argued some parts of the law could stand. Now, all of the law's protections will be at the mercy of conservative judges."
Tell me about it.
Let your representatives know what you think about the proposed budget and who it values. Make sure your friends and family do too.
"2. Send $8.6 billion to the president's border wall project to address a nonexistent national emergency, on top of $7 billion the administration has already allocated."
The budget would cut or remove the following over the next decade:  - $845 billion from Medicare - $241 billion from Medicaid - $220 billion from the SNAP nutrition program for low-income families - $207 billion from federal student loan programs
"An administration's budget says a lot about what—and, more importantly, who—it values.   So let's talk about the Trump administration's 2020 budget proposal and why it makes clear that this administration doesn’t value seniors, low-income families, and young people."
My heart breaks for New Zealand & the global Muslim community. We must continue to fight the perpetuation and normalization of Islamophobia and racism in all its forms.   White supremacist terrorists must be condemned by leaders everywhere. Their murderous hatred must be stopped.
Our democracy should work for everyone. House Democrats have passed a bill that would fix it through:  - Automatic voter registration - Early voting everywhere - Public election financing - An end to gerrymandering  Call your senators and ask them to support #HR1: (202) 224-3121
"So think of a woman you know who should run for office. Then take a moment today to ask her to do it.   Tell her she'll have help from @emergeamerica, @emilyslist, @runforsomething, and you.   With one question, you could start something pretty big."
"For #InternationalWomensDay, I'm issuing you a challenge.   We know that when women run for office, they're elected at the same rate as men.   But not as many women run as men—often because people don't ask women to run as often as they ask men."
In other words: Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights. Period.   Call your members of Congress today and ask them to support the Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act: (202) 224-3121 #ReproRightsAreHumanRights
"By requiring annual reporting on women's access to basic health care like contraception, safe abortion, and maternal health care around the world, Congress can make sure the rights of women and girls will no longer be up for grabs in each election."
Women's reproductive rights are human rights that are universal and indivisible.   Governments do not get to pick and choose whose rights and which rights will be respected.
"I introduced reproductive rights sections to the reports while I was secretary of state because access to reproductive health care is a protected human right affecting women's right to life, equality, and freedom from inhumane treatment."
Her U.S. asylum officer opens up the State Department's human rights reports and finds no information about those 17 women imprisoned for miscarrying or El Salvador's abortion ban. He deems she has no credible fear of persecution if she returns home. He denies her application.
"Imagine how this can play out. A woman living in El Salvador, where abortion is banned, is raped and becomes pregnant. She suffers a miscarriage and decides to flee the country knowing that 17 of her countrywomen were sentenced to up to 40 years in prison after miscarrying."
Of particular note: U.S. immigration judges and asylum officers use the human rights reports to evaluate the credibility of an applicant's fear of persecution. Human rights reports that contradict an asylum seeker in virtually any way can be fatal to an asylum application.
"Human rights advocates, lawmakers, academics, businesses, NGOs, and other institutions all over the world use the reports to inform their work as well."
Some background:   All branches of the U.S. government use the State Department's human rights reports to shape policy and inform decision-making around diplomacy and allocations of aid and security.
Important legislation introduced yesterday: The Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act would correct the Trump administration's dangerous decision to remove reporting on reproductive rights from the State Department's annual reports on human rights practices around the world.
A second call you can make right now to help families who want to reunite with their kids:   Call your member of Congress and ask them to put pressure on CBP to grant asylum to parents applying in Mexicali today.   The Capitol switchboard number is 202-224-3121.
".@fams2gether, @ACLU and others are in Mexicali today working to reunify families the administration has separated. Help by calling @CBP now at 1-855-681-1349 and demand that CBP allow parents to apply for asylum—their legal right—so they can be reunited with their children."
"The House just passed a bill to require background checks on all gun sales in the country. It's the first gun control legislation to pass since 1994. Thank @gabbygiffords, @lucymcbath, @speakerpelosi and so many others for their work on this issue by calling your senators!"
"Permanent funding should be a bipartisan matter and easy to get done. Indeed, it should have been done already.   Call your member of Congress now and ask them to vote for the ""Never Forget the Heroes"" Act: (202) 224-3121"

"I urge Nicolás Maduro to allow humanitarian aid inside Venezuela’s borders peacefully. People are in need of life-saving medicines, children are subsisting on one meal a day, and a peaceful delivery of food and supplies is to the benefit of all."
The administration just put a gag rule in place that bars Title X health care providers from referring patients for safe and legal abortions.   It's an attack on Planned Parenthood and 1.6 million patients who may not be able to afford care anywhere else. #IStandWithPP #NoGagRule
"Congratulations to @IamMinyon and her co-authors on the @NAACP Image Award nominations of “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics."" It's a wonderful, necessary book."

"Actions have consequences, and whether we’re in Syria or not, the people who want to harm us are there & at war. Isolationism is weakness. Empowering ISIS is dangerous. Playing into Russia & Iran’s hands is foolish. This President is putting our national security at grave risk."

"This is not in line with American values, and it’s a dangerous path. It's a fundamental building block of democracy that elected representatives respect the outcome of elections. To ignore those outcomes is to silence voters and endanger the health of our democracy itself."
"Republicans in Michigan and Wisconsin lost elections on Nov. 6. Rather than respect the will of voters, they're using their last few weeks in office to pass laws limiting the power of new governors and put roadblocks on voting. It's not just anti-Democratic. It's anti-democratic."

The Trump administration tried to bury a federally-mandated climate change study by releasing it the Friday after Thanksgiving. Here's what they didn't want you to hear:
"In Europe, nationalists like Hungary’s Viktor Orban are exploiting this challenge to stoke fear and resentment. To defeat them and protect democracy, the EU needs a more comprehensive policy that builds societies that are both secure and welcoming."
"On both sides of the Atlantic, we need reform. Not open borders, but immigration laws enforced with fairness and respect for human rights. We can’t let fear or bias force us to give up the values that have made our democracies both great and good."
"In a recent interview, I talked about how Europe must reject right-wing nationalism and authoritarianism, including by addressing migration with courage and compassion. I also gave a comprehensive speech about this last month."
"Trump has made it worse with cruel abuses at the border, detaining children and separating them from their families. It’s one of the most shameful moments in our history."
"We passed bipartisan comprehensive reform when I was a senator, but House Republicans killed it. Since then, the GOP has refused to make progress and instead uses the issue to divide our country."
"and brings millions of hardworking people into the formal economy, fixes the family visa backlog, upholds the rule of law, and protects our borders and national security."
"I have always been and remain a staunch advocate of comprehensive immigration reform that’s true to our values and treats every person with dignity, provides a pathway to full and equal citizenship…"
May we all open our hearts and reach across tables today. May we all find hopes and values in common. May there be pie. Happy Thanksgiving.

".@AndrewGillum ran an extraordinary campaign for governor, full of hope and focused on the needs and dreams of Florida families. Andrew, I'm proud of you and I can't wait to see what you do next."
"Thank you, @StaceyAbrams, for fighting for Georgia and for the integrity of our elections. Everyone should be able to exercise their right to vote. Every vote should be counted."
"Even in 1992, when I first met him, it was clear Chad Griffin would do a lot of good in the world. Little did I know! Grateful for his leadership at @HRC in fighting against discrimination and for marriage equality, and mobilizing millions to build a more just, equal America."
"As of last week, over 200 children in detention near the border are still separated from their families. It's been over 100 days since the deadline for the administration to reunite them."
"So proud of my friend @Ann_OLeary, who was just announced as Governor @GavinNewsom’s chief of staff. Ann is brilliant, hard-working, and kind. I know her team will do great things for California."
"Thank you all for your service to your country. Take a well-deserved rest, and then let's keep going."
".@alliance4youth, @IndivisibleTeam, and @swingleft set about organizing locally to mobilize young people and win back Congress. I truly don't think we would have won back the House without them."
".@iVoteFund has defended democracy itself, fighting hard against voter suppression and for secretaries of state and local measures that will make it easier for every American to exercise their right to vote."
.@ColorOfChange and @DomesticWorkers have spent the last two years waging campaigns to defend civil rights against the administration's attacks and building powerful communities for change.
".@LatinoVictoryUS and @VotoLatino have worked to mobilize Latino voters and elect progressive Latino candidates, sending dozens of amazing candidates to office up and down the ballot."
".@arenasummit, @CollectivePAC, @EmergeAmerica, and @runforsomething have collectively recruited, trained, and supported hundreds of candidates up and down the ballot. They are building a Democratic bench, candidate by candidate and race by race."
"These organizations are recruiting a new Democratic bench, defending rights, and organizing locally to fight for progressive policies that improve people's lives. I'm so proud."
Thanks and congratulations to all our @OnwardTogether partners for two years of hard work that paid off in a big way this week.
"Congratulations to Lucy McBath for winning her race for Georgia's sixth congressional district. Lucy entered public life after her son, Jordan, was shot and killed. Now, she's brought her voice to Congress in the fight to prevent gun violence. Onward, Lucy!"
"Our work is far from over. As we celebrate our wins, let's be clear about what's ahead.   This is a crucial step in a long road to repairing our democracy. It'll take all of us to do it. What a start this is."
"Win or lose, what you've built will continue long after last night."
"None of these victories would have been possible if people had simply given up after the heartbreak of 2016. They belong to all the volunteers and candidates who worked impossible hours, logged hundreds of miles, and knocked on countless doors."
"There were important wins for rights, too, including Floridians voting to restore the voting rights of 1 million of their fellow citizens and Nevada approving automatic voter registration."
"These historic firsts are important not just because representation matters (and it does), but because these extraordinary women will bring perspectives that have been absent from our policy debates for far too long."
"The inspiring Lucy McBath became an activist for common-sense gun reform after her son, Jordan, was shot and killed. This cycle, she ran for Congress in a heavily Republican district in Georgia—and it looks likely she will win."
Janet Mills will be the first woman governor of Maine. Cindy Axne and Abby Finkenauer will be the first women to represent Iowa in the House. Finkenauer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are the youngest women to be elected to Congress ever.
"Ayanna Pressley and Jahana Hayes will be the first black women to represent Massachusetts and Connecticut in Congress, respectively. Tish James will be the first black woman to be New York's attorney general."
Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland will be the first Native American women to ever serve in Congress. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar will be the first Muslim women to serve.
"It was a historic night in so many ways: For the first time ever, over 100 women were elected to Congress—including a record number of women of color."
"Congratulations to all the voters, volunteers, organizers, and candidates who voted last night to put a powerful check on this administration and start building a better future for everyone in our country."
"Remember, Georgia: If you’re in line when the polls close at 7pm, you can still cast a ballot—so stay in line and vote! While the GOP has been trying to make this election about anything but the future you want for your families, you are on the verge of making history."
"If they win, they’ll do great things for America. Let's exercise our birthright as Americans today, put those people in office, and continue the hard work of saving our democracy.   It'll take all of us. Happy Election Day."
"But we won't just vote against radicalism, bigotry, and corruption today.   We'll vote for fantastic candidates all over the country—including a historic number of women—who want to raise wages, fight for justice, and help more people get health care."
"For the past two years, we've watched this administration attack and undermine our democratic institutions and values. Today, we say enough."
"However and wherever you choose to GOTV this weekend, thank you for getting in there! We'll win back our democracy if we work for it."
Need some brushing up on your GOTV-ing skills before heading out for the last four days? Here are some tireless organizations that have you covered:
It's more important than ever this week to remember the children who have still not been reunited with their families after this administration separated them at the border months ago. Vote to repudiate this horrendous policy. Vote to reject the bigotry that led to it.
"People are more likely to vote when their friends nudge them to vote. They're also more likely to vote when they have a plan to vote. So ask a friend today: ""What's your plan to vote?"""
Governors set the tone and direction for their states. They’re also our last line of defense against some of the Trump administration’s worst policies. So pick a candidate—or two or three—and help flip one of these 17 races. One week to go.
"In one week, we have the chance to flip 17 governorships from red to blue. Here are four incredible candidates who deserve your support:"
"It was such a delight to talk with the @BGTX team tonight. They’re turning Texas into a battleground state by treating it like one, from endorsing an all-women slate of candidates to registering 55,000 voters this cycle. Hard work pays off. Keep it going—eight more days! #GameOn"
My thoughts are with everyone affected by this morning’s horrific shooting at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We can and must put a stop to this violence and this hate. It should have no home in America.
We are forever grateful to have known him and will always be proud members of #GayleNation.
"He spent his 30 years doing all the good he could, in all the ways he could, for as long as he could. Our prayers are with Tyrone’s family, especially his wife, Beth, and their huge community of devoted friends."
"Whatever he did, he did with his whole heart—whether he was running sprints, planning his wedding to the love of his life, rooting for his beloved Clemson Tigers, or working to build an America as kind, compassionate, and big-hearted as Tyrone himself."
"Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, lobbied hard for the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act. They knew it wouldn't bring their son back, but they wanted other LGBT people to have that protection and justice. May their example inspire us all in these times."
"Matthew Shepard's ashes were laid to rest in the Washington National Cathedral today. Two days later, we’ll mark the nine-year anniversary of President Obama signing a law that bears Matthew’s name."
"America is one of the oldest democracies in the world, and voting is our most sacred right as citizens. Let's make it easy for every single American to cast a ballot."
"Fourth, vote for state legislature candidates and governors who will support laws that make voting registration automatic, make vote by mail possible, and extend early voting periods. @Sister_District, @flippable_org, and @TheDLCC are excellent organizations to plug into."
"What can we do to protect our right to vote?   First, know that it's still likely that you'll be able to vote quickly and easily. Problems in some areas doesn't mean there are problems everywhere."
"Fast-forward a few years: 24 states have put new voting restrictions in place since 2010, including photo ID rules in Alabama, ""use it or lose it"" laws in Ohio, and ""exact match"" laws in Georgia."
"First, some history. The 2013 Supreme Court case Shelby v. Holder gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act by ruling that states with a history of voter suppression no longer needed the federal government to approve changes to voting rules."
"Let's talk about voter suppression, how you can protect your rights in this election, and how we can fight to make America a place where every citizen can make their voice heard."
"I'm grateful for the hard work and commitment of the Secret Service every day, and never more than this week."
"Whatever you choose to do, do something. With only two weeks before the election, we don't have a moment to lose."
"There are many organizations doing great work in the states, but I'd like to highlight three in particular—including two @OnwardTogether partners, @Sister_District and @Flippable_org:"
"State legislature races are also a great way to make an impact as an activist. The budgets and walk lists are smaller than those of congressional races, so you can move the needle with a few volunteer hours or donations."
"Winning back state legislatures is also important in this last election before the 2020 Census. State legislatures redraw congressional districts every 10 years based on those numbers, and Democratic legislative majorities can shut down gerrymandering that disenfranchises voters."
"State legislatures with Democratic majorities can help preserve access to the ballot for people of color, reproductive freedoms for women, the rights of LGBTQ people, protections for immigrants, Medicaid expansions, and more."
A reality of a Supreme Court with a right-wing majority is that the states are a new important front in protecting civil rights—especially the rights of the most vulnerable among us.
"The administration's deadline to reunite families it separated at the border passed 12 weeks ago today. What is their plan to rectify this great wrong, and to do it immediately?"
"Whatever you do, do something. These midterm elections are our last chance to defend our democracy. Let's win."
"Our democracy is in crisis. The president degrades the rule of law, spreads corruption, and discredits truth. Over the next three weeks, we all have a chance to turn back the tide. Here are three things you can do before November 6:"
"If you could use a bit of hope and inspiration this week, let me introduce you to a few young leaders who are turning solutions to global challenges into action at @CGIU, Clinton Global Initiative's year-round program for up-and-coming social entrepreneurs and innovators."
"Eleven weeks ago, the administration was supposed to finish reunifying families it separated at the border. Eleven weeks on, families are still waiting and wondering when they'll see their loved ones again. Every additional minute they wait is an injustice."
".@ColinAllredTX, @JenniferWexton, @RosenForNevada, @JasonCrow06, @WildForCongress, @Lizzie4Congress, @Joshua_Harder, and @MikeLevinCA are working hard to talk to voters about how gun violence has affected their lives, and what we can all do to make our communities safer."
"We have another chance to make progress this fall, when eight brave candidates for Congress will be on the ballot facing some of the gun lobby's biggest defenders."
"They told me about their grief, and also about their anger and frustration toward a political system that couldn’t seem to take action to prevent other kids from dying from unnecessary gun violence."
Some of the most painful and rewarding conversations I have had on the campaign trail were with parents who had lost their children to gun violence.
"The world is watching. Northern Ireland has been a symbol to people everywhere of democracy’s power to transcend divisions and deliver prosperity, peace, and progress. We need that symbol, that reality, now more than ever."
"Democracy is a habit. It must be practiced again and again. Yes, that means voting. But it also means debating and compromising, participating in shared institutions, and honoring the rights and needs of all citizens."
"It’s crucial that however it comes out, Brexit should not be allowed to undermine the peace and prosperity that has been so dearly won here."
I do not come today as an authority with all the answers—only you will find those—but as a friend who knows how hard the people of Northern Ireland have worked and suffered to transcend old conflicts. You deserve a future worthy of that struggle.
"Now is the time to bring human rights out of the ivory tower and into what Eleanor Roosevelt called ""small places close to home""—into neighborhoods and schools, offices, factories, and farms, and the hearts and daily interactions of men and women everywhere."
"In the years since, in country after country, human rights have come to be seen not as a high-minded luxury but as a core national interest. But we have urgent work to do."
"Seventy years ago this December, 58 countries came together at the end of World War II to offer the world a roadmap for peace and prosperity strong enough to withstand the appeals of demagogues and the ravages of poverty and fear."
Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad’s work to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war has brought awareness to a horrific practice and helped survivors get the care they need. My heartfelt congratulations to both for their well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize.
"A full 10 weeks since the administration's deadline to reunite families they separated at the border, over 100 families are still waiting. #FamiliesBelongTogether"
"Pitch in to their campaigns if you can, reach out to friends in their districts to encourage their support, or start with a like or a follow. November 6th is only 36 days away, so there's no time to waste."
"If you're angry and ready for change, there's a concrete way to fight back: help candidates with progressive values win their elections on November 6th.   Here are some excellent @runforsomething-endorsed candidates who deserve your support:"
"There are excellent candidates running all over the country who will raise wages, bring down health-care costs, fight for justice, and provide some much-needed congressional oversight of the White House. Make sure you're ready to vote for them."
Have questions about voting? Call the DNC's voter hotline at 833-336-VOTE.
"In honor of National Voter Registration Day, I want to highlight some  tools you can use to get registered to vote and register friends. With only six weeks before the election, it's all hands on deck."
"Donate your time or money to their campaigns if you can. Our government should represent us, and Congress is only 20% women right now. Let's change that ratio!"
"With a historic number of women running this year, we have a tremendous opportunity to make our government better reflect our country. We'd all be lucky to see these four extraordinary candidates win their races for Congress this fall:"
"A reported 211 families are still waiting to be reunited since the administration separated them at the border. It's been a full eight weeks since the deadline to reunite them, and we all need to continue speaking out about this inexcusable delay. #FamiliesBelongTogether"
"Democracy works only when we accept that we’re in this together.   We can’t just ask, “Am I better off than I was four years ago?” We have to ask, “Are we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer?” Ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us."
"Above all, we need to find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and rekindle our civic spirit. We need to bring back civics education in our schools. We need systemic economic reforms that reduce inequality and give a strong voice to working families."
"We need to improve and protect our elections, from instituting paper ballot backups to repairing the Voting Rights Act, getting secret money out of politics, and—you won't be surprised to hear my support for this—abolishing the Electoral College."
"Then, we need to do some housecleaning. Just as Nixon’s abuses of power led to reforms, post-Trump all future presidential candidates should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules."
"First: We’ve got to mobilize turnout in the midterms. There are fantastic candidates all over the country who’ll do great things, and we could finally see some congressional oversight of the White House."
"With our democracy in crisis and our institutions and traditions under siege, we need to do everything we can to fight back. Here's how."
"Whether it was stealing a Supreme Court seat, gerrymandering congressional districts to disenfranchise African Americans, or muzzling government climate scientists, Republicans were undermining American democracy long before Trump made it to the Oval Office."
"We should be clear about this: The increasing radicalism and irresponsibility of the Republican Party, including decades of demeaning government, demonizing Democrats, and debasing norms, is what gave us Donald Trump."
"There is a tendency, when talking about these things, to wring our hands about ""both sides."" But the truth is that this is not a symmetrical problem."
Donald Trump refuses to be subject to the law. The legitimacy of our elections is in doubt. The president is waging war on the truth. The administration is undermining the national unity that makes democracy possible. And then there's the breathtaking corruption.
"On the day after the election, I hoped my fears for our country's future were overblown.   They were not."
"In sum: Kavanaugh doesn't think judges should consider public safety or allow common-sense gun laws. Meanwhile, 96 Americans are killed with guns every day.   Call your senators: (202) 224-3121"
"“Gun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding or sufficiently rooted in the text, history and tradition are not consistent with the Second Amendment individual right,"" he added."
"Judge Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. appeals court ruled in 2011 that the city could ban semiautomatic rifles and require handgun registration. He argued that courts shouldn't consider the public safety benefits of gun laws: ""Our task is to apply the Constitution."""
"Let's talk about Brett Kavanaugh's past rulings on guns. He's out of the mainstream, even among other conservative judges, in his willingness to strike down legislatures' public safety measures to prevent gun violence if they don't align with his politics."
The administration is now seven weeks late in meeting its deadline to reunite families they separated at the border. Hundreds of families have spent the past seven weeks waiting and worrying. There's no possible excuse for continuing to keep them apart. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Let’s be clear: Women have just as much right as men to make the most personal health decisions without government interference. We are equal citizens and we will insist on nothing less in this country.   Please call your senators and relay the message: (202) 224-3121
"Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: ""Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?"" He said he was not. Because there are none."
"Imagine an America in which women are barred from getting IUDs or birth control pills, and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them. It's an America in which women would be punished for insisting on being full and equal partners in society."
"When Kavanaugh called birth control ""abortion-inducing drugs,"" he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isn't the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too."
Kavanaugh didn't use that term because he misunderstands the basic  science of birth control—the fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because it's a dog whistle to the extreme right.
"I want to be sure we're all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as ""abortion-inducing drugs."" That set off a lot of alarm bells for me, and it should for you, too."
"May we always remember those we lost 17 years ago. May the love, bravery, and selflessness so many showed that day light our path forward."
We're not fighting for the planet in some abstract sense here. We're fighting for our continued ability to live on it.   Call your senators: (202) 224-3121
"Just last year, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPA's attempt to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a particularly dangerous greenhouse gas found in refrigeration and air conditioning units, was outside its authority."
"In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a ""thin statute"" to support the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants."
Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit Court in 2012 that struck down a federal program to curb cross-state pollution from power plants.
"During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases."
"Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years—maybe decades—that we can’t afford to waste on inaction."
"Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were ""well within"" the EPA's authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions."
Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up.
"This year has seen record-high temperatures across the world, the biggest wildfire in California history, and an unprecedented red tide in Florida.   It's urgent that we act to curb climate change—and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court could make progress virtually impossible."
"This fight isn't over until it's over, and the only thing we can count on in this era is that these battles won't always end the way we expect they will.   Share the number of the Senate switchboard with a friend right now: 202-224-3121"
"Just this year, the Court upheld purges of minority voters in Ohio as well as districts in Texas that were drawn to reduce the voting power of people of color. With a solid hard-right majority on the Court, we would see more decisions like those."
The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by ruling that states with a history of suppression no longer needed federal approval to change their voting laws. Kavanaugh's record indicates he would help a new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression.
"He wrote approvingly of ""recent changes to voting laws"" that include not just voter ID but also laws that put restrictions on registration and cut back on both early voting days and polling place locations. All these changes are shown to disproportionately affect voters of color."
"Kavanaugh voted in 2012 to uphold a South Carolina voter ID law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise 80,000 minority voters."
Today's reason to call your senators and urge them to #StopKavanaugh: Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast ballots.
"If you agree, please pick up the phone right now and call your senators. Ask them to #StopKavanaugh: (202) 224-3121"
One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about one's own body. To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures.
"It's remarkable that we have to keep repeating this, even in 2018: Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights."
"Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh, considering him a reliable vote to overturn Roe. His confirmation would be a victory for activists who want to end a woman's right to make her own health decisions."
Kavanaugh ruled to let CEOs decide to deny their employees insurance coverage for no co-pay birth control.
"As a federal judge, Kavanaugh tried to prevent a young undocumented woman in government custody from exercising her right to an abortion."
"A few weeks before Kavanaugh's name appeared on President Trump's short list for a new justice, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in the Roe v. Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his “hero,” noting that “he clearly wanted to overrule Roe.”"
"If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will."
"This is as serious as it gets. It's up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans—again.   As Kavanaugh's hearings begin, make sure your senators hear from you: (202) 224-3121"
"Supreme Court seats are for life. Your senators' votes on Kavanaugh could affect whether you, your loved ones, and millions of other Americans can get affordable health care for decades."
"Kavanaugh has also claimed that the president can simply decide not to implement the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans in the lurch."
"In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality of the ACA. In 2017, he criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling to uphold the law five years earlier."
"The next Supreme Court justice will have a chance to rule on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which helps millions of people get affordable health care. Brett Kavanaugh’s record shows he’d be a threat to the law."
"Challenges to the Affordable Care Act's protections for patients, including the notion that insurance companies can't refuse to insure you if you have a pre-existing condition, are already working their way through the lower courts."
"Unions and labor movements are why we have workplace safety precautions, collective bargaining, weekends, minimum wages, and, yes, Labor Day.   We can't afford more damage to workers' rights. Make sure your senators hear from you: Let's #StopKavanaugh."
"In 2016, Kavanaugh held that corporations have the right to punish workers for displaying pro-union signs in their cars."
"In 2014, he dissented in a case where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration held SeaWorld accountable for the death of a trainer."
"In 2007, Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers' ability to bargain collectively."
"In other words, the Court has already been widening the disparity in power between corporations and workers. Kavanaugh's record from his time as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shows he'd help further that trend for a generation."
The Court has also recently granted corporations the right to deny workers reproductive health care and made it harder for workers to sue businesses by allowing companies to force employees to sign mandatory arbitration clauses with their contracts.
"That ruling won't just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts. It'll hurt all workers, because union deals on wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions do, too."
The Court's ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this summer overturned a 40-year-old precedent to hold that public-sector workers with union contracts don't have to pay fees for collective bargaining expenses if they're not members.
"The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows to workers and unions in the last few years. With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people."
"Happy Labor Day. There's no better time to talk about why workers’ rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed."
"Today's celebration of Aretha Franklin's life was like the lady herself: Joyful, profound, and full of song. Thank you to everyone who performed, spoke in remembrance, and made it a send-off worthy of her."
"Over 500 children are still waiting to be reunited with their parents, five weeks after the administration's deadline to reunify families. Every day they are made to wait is a tragedy."
These are just a few of countless stories that we should never read about events happening within our borders.
"First, it’s been nearly five weeks since the deadline for the administration to reunite families they separated at the border, but 528 children are still waiting to see their parents again."
"There's a lot going on right now—understatement of the year.   The separation of families and the failure of the administration to reunite them has been eclipsed in the news in recent days, but these tragic circumstances persist.   Here are some of the latest developments:"
"The next Supreme Court justice could shift the court to the right for decades, with devastating consequences for reproductive rights, health care, workers' rights, and voting rights."
".@SenJohnMcCain lived a life of service to his country, from his heroism in the Navy to 35 years in Congress. He was a tough politician, a trusted colleague, and there will simply never be another like him. My thoughts and prayers are with Cindy and his entire family."
"A full month has passed since the deadline for the administration to reunite families it separated at the border, but 565 children are still waiting to see their parents again. #FamiliesBelongTogether"
".@LatinoVictoryUS is dedicated to electing Latino candidates to all levels of government, building Latino political power, and ""making Trump furious."""
I’d like to encourage you to support some extraordinary organizations we're proud to have on the @OnwardTogether team:
"It's been three weeks since the deadline for the administration to reunify families it separated at the border. Today, 565 children are still reportedly separated from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether"
"Mourning the loss today of @ArethaFranklin who shared her spirit and talent with the world. She deserves not only our RESPECT but also our lasting gratitude for opening our eyes, ears and hearts. Rest in eternal peace, my friend."
I’m so proud of you Rebecca. And you should be proud of all you’ve accomplished. There’s a bright future ahead!
".@KingJames is a great family man, incredible ballplayer, gives back to his community, and isn’t afraid to speak his mind. He’s a world class athlete and a class act. We need more like him in this world."
It's been a week since the deadline for the administration to reunify families it split up at the border. More than 559 children are still reportedly separated from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether
"I’m thrilled to be joining forces with Steven Spielberg to bring @efweiss5’s book “The Woman’s Hour” to TV. It’s about the women who fought for suffrage nearly 100 years ago. We stand on their shoulders, and I’m delighted to have a hand in helping to tell their stories."
".@VotoLatino is working to engage Latinos in the civic process. They recently helped register 5,000 people in just one day at March For Our Lives events. Their goal: register 422,000 voters for the 2018 midterms and turn out 80% of those people."
".@CollectivePAC recruits, trains, and funds progressive black candidates at every level of government. They've helped elect 23 officials so far and are doing a series of trainings for candidates and operatives with the goal of training 200 people by 2019 and 2020."
"When @RunForSomething launched, they expected to find 100 people who wanted to run for local office. Instead, they've recruited 17,000 young candidates in all 50 states, built a network of 6,000 volunteers, and endorsed 308 candidates. Their new goal: recruit 50k candidates."
We had our first annual @OnwardTogether members call yesterday. Thank you to the thousands of members who joined. We had a chance to hear from a few of our partner groups about the progress they're making to strengthen our democracy. I want to share some of it with you.
"From mother to activist to candidate - congratulations to @LucyWins2018 on winning the nomination for Congress in #GA06. No one is more determined or resilient, and she will bring an important voice to Congress for the people of Georgia. Onward to November!"
"My thoughts are with these families and with everyone who is working to reunite them. Special thanks to Paco, Jaime, Juan, Vanessa, and Pamela, DACA recipients who are working hard at reunification sites to help these families get to their next destinations."
"Follow, help fund, and volunteer for groups that are working on the ground to reunify families, including:  @ACLU @CCharitiesUSA @domesticworkers @FWDus @LIRSorg @RAICESTEXAS @TXCivilRights @WomenBelong @WRCommission"
"Thousands of families who have been separated at the border still need to be reunited.   In some cases, children have been sent to states far from Texas and Arizona, where their parents were detained.  Here’s how we can help:"
Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?
"We should be a better country than one that tears families apart, turns a blind eye to women fleeing domestic violence, and treats frightened children as a means to a political end."
"Those who selectively use the Bible to justify this cruelty are ignoring a central tenet of Christianity. Jesus said ""Suffer the little children unto me."" He did not say “let the children suffer.”"
"Despite what this White House claims, separating families is not mandated by law. That is an outright lie, and it’s incumbent on all of us – journalists and citizens alike – to call it just that."
"What’s happening to families at the border right now is a humanitarian crisis. Every parent who has ever held a child in their arms, every human being with a sense of compassion and decency, should be outraged."
"There is no more important test of our country than the way we treat the most vulnerable among us, especially children. We cannot turn away from what’s happening on our watch - we have to act."
It is now the official policy of the US government - a nation of immigrants - to separate children from their families. That is an absolute disgrace. #FamiliesBelongTogether.
"He said that “In the immigration context, the government has never taken a stand against the protection of kids in this country. For the first time, it is now formally taking a position that explicitly goes against the best interests of kids.”"
Muzaffar Chishti of @MigrationPolicy said something that has stuck with me.
"Not only that - this administration built on their ""zero tolerance"" policy earlier this month. The result? Nearly 700 more kids were separated from their families in the first two weeks of the new program. Think about that. Hundreds of families torn apart in two weeks."
"We now know that more than 700 kids were separated from their parents between October 2017 and April 2018. As a mother and a grandmother, it’s devastating to even imagine."
"Like so many others, I am horrified and heartbroken by what is happening to immigrant kids and families because of this administration’s disastrous policies."
"More than 4,600 lives lost in Puerto Rico. 70x the official number. The US gov’t has failed its own citizens. The response itself is an American tragedy.  Hurricane season is about to begin in Puerto Rico. The administration must step up & protect its people."
"To Evan, Susan, and the whole family, we are thinking about you and praying for you.  If anyone can take on this fight it’s Susan Bayh, with the strength, courage, and grace she brings to everything she does."
"Every day that we fail to act on gun violence, we are failing our children. This should be a day for soul searching across America - and that soul searching should be matched with legislating to begin dealing with this national shame."
"As Secretary of State, I helped negotiate the crippling international sanctions that brought Iran to the table. It would be much harder a second time, now that our credibility is shot."
Pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal is a big mistake. It makes America less safe and less trusted. Iran is now more dangerous. What's plan B? Anyone who thinks bombing is the answer is woefully misinformed.
See you soon @alliance4youth @arenasummit @CollectivePac @ColorOfChange @EmergeAmerica @IndivisibleTeam @iVoteFund @latinovictoryus @runforsomething @swingleft @votolatino!
Heading into NYC for @OnwardTogether’s first annual Partners Collaborative to discuss how we can work together to defend our progressive values.
Thinking about Barbara Bush’s legacy of service to our country and the extraordinary family she raised. Thanking her for her many kindnesses to me and my family. Wishing her the comfort she deserves surrounded by her loved ones.
"Wishing @JuliaGillard, Former Aussie PM, the best for today’s launch of her new Global Institute for Women’s Leadership, based at King’s College London. @GIWLkings will help create a world in which being a woman is not a barrier to becoming a leader. #womensleadership"
"Congresswoman Louise Slaughter was a tireless advocate for her constituents in New York. She showed me the ropes when I was first elected to the Senate in 2000, & did the same for so many of our colleagues. I was lucky to call her a friend. She will be missed."
"To all the students across our country who took part in #NationalWalkoutDay: Never let anybody tell you your voices don’t make a difference. You‘re an inspiration to millions of Americans who know commonsense gun reform is long overdue. We are with you, and we will not give up."
I’m forever grateful to you for being such an outspoken champion and advocate for women. Having allies like you on our side means the world - today and every day.
"In honor of #InternationalWomensDay, I want to celebrate some of the women and girls who inspire me every day.  These women resist inequality, insist on a better world, persist against all odds, and enlist others in our shared fights."
"Saw Black Panther with Bill this afternoon & loved it. Beautiful film, lots of action, and a great message. Don't miss it!"
"Mass shootings are not inevitable. The majority of Americans support common sense gun reform. Though we feel angry, heartbroken, even helpless now, we have the power to elect people who will protect lives, not gun sellers’ profits. Remember these feelings in November, and VOTE."
"Now is the time to listen to the students, teachers, and parents demanding that we end this carnage once and for all with gun safety laws that keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them."
"This week we lost 17 Americans in Parkland - the deadliest school shooting since Sandy Hook in 2012. Since then, 438 people have been shot and 138 killed in over 230 school shootings. That’s 5 school shootings every month, 16 of which classify as “mass shootings.”"
🙏
I called her today to tell her how proud I am of her and to make sure she knows what all women should: we deserve to be heard.
"A story appeared today about something that happened in 2008. I was dismayed when it occurred, but was heartened the young woman came forward, was heard, and had her concerns taken seriously and addressed."
"Thank you, @CecileRichards, for your tireless advocacy on behalf of women and girls, and for your grace under pressure over these last 12 years. And thank you to @PPFA for all you’ve done and continue to do to advance reproductive rights. Onward!"
"In 2017, the Women’s March was a beacon of hope and defiance. In 2018, it is a testament to the power and resilience of women everywhere. Let’s show that same power in the voting booth this year. #PowerToThePolls"
"The anniversary of the devastating earthquake 8 years ago is a day to remember the tragedy, honor the resilient people of Haiti, & affirm America’s commitment to helping our neighbors. Instead, we‘re subjected to Trump’s ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn’t look like him."
Nancy has a record of beating the odds - from DC to CA - where she helped Gov Brown do a fantastic job. All who know her are sending strength & love as she faces this latest challenge.  Onward my friend. -H
Families across America had to start 2018 worried that their kids wouldn’t have health care. Failing to act now shows the true face of Republicans & their donor-driven immoral agenda. You control the Senate agenda @SenateMajLdr. Enough is enough.
"The Iranian people, especially the young, are protesting for the freedom and future they deserve. I hope their government responds peacefully and supports their hopes."
Thank you to everyone who has donated to Onward Together in our first year -- we’re only able to support these great groups because of you. Let’s do even more in 2018. Onward!
"Along with @IndivisibleTeam, @ColorOfChange, @EmergeAmerica, @swingleft, and @runforsomething, I know these groups will continue to do the incredible work of making our democracy stronger in 2018, and I'm proud to be on their team."
"And with the help of @collectivepac, 23 African-American candidates have been elected to local, state, and federal offices since August 2016."
More than 400 students and leaders met last month at the @votolatino Power Summit to share resources and tools for national advocacy.
The team at @latinovictoryus is working to elect more Latino candidates at every level of government.
"At @alliance4youth, young people are using local organizing to address economic inequality, attacks on voting rights, and more."
"450 brand-new civic leaders and activists attended the very first @ArenaSummit -- and they're on track to train 5,000 people by the end of 2018."
The organizers at @iVoteFund worked with partners on the ground to get automatic voter registration on the ballot in Nevada.
"Onward Together is ending 2017 by supporting six more incredible organizations fighting to protect voting rights and to make it easier for young, diverse candidates to get on the ballot and get elected."
"@ELaffGarb, thinking of you, @nelba_MG, and all the Sandy Hook families this week. Thank you for your courage."
"Tonight, Alabama voters elected a senator who'll make them proud.   And if Democrats can win in Alabama, we can -- and must -- compete everywhere.  Onward!"
Mayor Ed Lee’s death is a terrible loss for the people of San Francisco. He was a good friend & a vocal advocate for the city he served & loved. My thoughts are with his family.
"I’m going to keep tweeting about this, and speaking out every chance I get, until it is fixed."
"So in these surreal times, let’s rally together & take action.  Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor & vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that it’s the very least they can do."
"How is it that in the middle of dividing up $1.5 trillion dollars between corporations & the ultra-wealthy, Republicans can’t find the time & money to take care of children? These are perverse priorities. Congress needs to pass CHIP now, as they have every year since the 1990s."
"It gets worse. During the campaign I warned that the Rs would come after social security, Medicare, & Medicaid & now they are. Imagine buying a Rolex & paying for it with money you saved to take care of your kids. That’s what Congress is doing w/ your tax dollars."
"Meanwhile, Senate Republicans rushed to pass so-called tax reform - a giveaway for those who least need it."
"The Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids & has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago."
"There’s a lot to be frustrated by right now, to say the least. Here’s something that we should be able to fix."
Sometimes it’s hard to know what to do after a loss. Not this time.  This tax bill is only going to get worse as people learn more about it. There are 6 GOP Senators that have to run on it & 2 open seats in 2018.  We all need to get to work.
"Two friends on a perfect day. Sincerely, me."
"Thank you to all who have worn our country's uniform, and the families who serve with them. Happy Veterans Day."
"As we celebrate, let’s also remember the work ahead. Proud that groups that Onward Together supports—including @SwingLeft, which is laser-focused on taking back the House—have been making incredible progress in the fight for 2018 and beyond. Onward!"
"So many groups own a piece of last night's victory, from @theDemocrats to @EMILYsList to @TheDLCC. It's remarkable to watch our Democratic family—groups with decades of victories and those born in the aftermath of the last election—team up to make nights like last night possible."
And the important work done by @ColorofChange’s PAC was instrumental in winning the district attorney race in Philadelphia.
"Our friends at @IndivisibleTeam report that their local groups made more than 600,000 calls into the Commonwealth to help elect @RalphNortham @FairfaxJustin @MarkHerringVA."
".@EmergeAmerica-trained candidates won all across the country, including 9 of the seats Democrats won in Virginia's House of Delegates."
"They tell me about 10% of first-time candidates usually win, but 40% of @runforsomething candidates came out on top yesterday."
Congratulations to @RunforSomething founders @amandalitman + @RossMoRock for a huge night! 25 of the local candidates they helped to recruit and run won.
Last night was a great reminder of what’s possible when we come together and fight for what we believe in. So I wanted to take a few minutes to celebrate the extraordinary successes of a few groups I—and Onward Together—proudly fight alongside.
"And if you live in New York state like I do, there are a lot of important races today, so go out and vote—I did!"
New Jersey: you have the chance to elect @PhilMurphyNJ @SheilaOliverNJ and other great Dems today. Take it!
Virginians: my friends @RalphNortham @FairfaxJustin @MarkHerringVA need you to show up and vote to get across the finish line.
"Live in VA, NJ, WA, NY or anywhere with an election today? Consider this my personal ask/nudge/plea for you to go to the polls and VOTE."
"New York's resilience is stronger than a cowardly act of terror. Thinking of the victims, their families, & the responders who saved lives."
Call Congress @ (202) 224-3121. Tell them we must work together to get this done for the children & families counting on CHIP. 7/7
"Grateful to the Senate Finance Committee for passing a strong and much needed bipartisan reauthorization bill. Now, let's get this done. 6/7"
The test of any society is how it treats its children. We cannot allow millions of kids to lose access to basic health care. 5/7
"Right now, many states are getting ready to send out notices to parents, letting them know that their kids’ coverage is in jeopardy. 4/7"
"Back in the '90s, Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass CHIP. Today, it covers 9 million kids. 2/7"
"This hasn't gotten enough attn: For the first time, Congress missed the deadline to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. 1/7"
"Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again."
"The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots.   Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get."
"Las Vegas, we are grieving with you—the victims, those who lost loved ones, the responders, & all affected by this cold-blooded massacre."
"Julia, you're in our thoughts and our hearts. Inspired but not surprised to see you using your platform for good in this difficult moment."
Nothing is more important than saving the Affordable Care Act from another cruel effort to take health care away from millions of people.
"Today we remember those we lost on September 11, 2001, and reflect on the sacrifice of the victims and responders. We'll never forget."
"Barcelona, you have our resolve and support in the face of this cowardly attack. We stand together against terrorism wherever it strikes."
"We will not step backward. If this is not who we are as Americans, let's prove it."
Now is the time for leaders to be strong in their words & deliberate in their actions.
"Every minute we allow this to persist through tacit encouragement or inaction is a disgrace, & corrosive to our values."
But the incitement of hatred that got us here is as real and condemnable as the white supremacists in our streets.
"My heart is in Charlottesville today, and with everyone made to feel unsafe in their country."
"John McCain is as tough as they come.  Thinking of John, Cindy, their wonderful children, & their whole family tonight."
Their determination & passion is truly inspiring. And I can't wait to see what this new generation of women leaders accomplishes. Onward!
"Today, @emilyslist announced that 15,000+ women have reached out since Election Day about running for office! 7,000+ want to help them run."
"For more than 30 years, @emilyslist has paved the way for women to run & succeed in elected office, including me."
"If you're waiting for the right moment to call your Senator about Trumpcare, the moment is now. Don't wait until it's too late. 202-224-3121"
"Best of luck to the Member Team & the Press Team tonight at the @CWSoftballGame, which raises money for young women with cancer. #CWSG"
A historic mistake. The world is moving forward together on climate change. Paris withdrawal leaves American workers & families behind.
Outraged & angry about this cowardly terror attack on a crowd of young people. Sending sympathy & strength to victims & people of Manchester
"This year hasn't been what I envisioned, but I know what I'm still fighting for: a kinder, big-hearted, inclusive America. Onward!"
"Those are just a few of the groups Onward Together will support, working with @GovHowardDean and others—stay tuned for more to come."
".@EmergeAmerica is training diverse Democratic women candidates, and thousands of young people have signed up to @runforsomething."
".@ColorOfChange is organizing for criminal justice reform, voter freedom, fairness and accuracy in media, and other racial justice issues."
"People across America have made their voices heard thanks to @IndivisibleTeam, and supported @swingleft's efforts to take back the House."
"More than ever, I believe citizen engagement is vital to our democracy. I'm so inspired by everyone stepping up to organize and lead."
"The last few months, I've been reflecting, spending time with family—and, yes, taking walks in the woods."
"Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, & the world.   Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that)"
"Great to see ppl take to the streets & combat climate change, protect the next generation & fight for jobs & economic justice. #climatemarch"
"Let’s not be distracted. Let’s continue to stand up, organize, resist, put forth good ideas to improve the existing system & peoples' lives."
"Luisa, who suffered from bone cancer and needed care ASAP - but the hospital wouldn't admit her without proof of insurance."
But this fight isn't over yet and we can't forget who it's about. Here are some stories...
"Congrats to @DNC chair @TomPerez & deputy @keithellison. Excited for strong, unified party standing for best of our country into the future."
"JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS."
3-0
I stand with the people gathered across the country tonight defending our values & our Constitution. This is not who we are.
"Thanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch. Important as ever. I truly believe we're always Stronger Together."
I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values. I will never stop believing in our country & its future. #Inauguration
The holidays are a time to be thankful for our blessings. Let's rejoice in this season & look forward with renewed hope & determination. -H

"“I will do everything I can to get incomes rising again for hardworking people…you deserve to be part of a growing, thriving middle class.”"
Trump wants to give the biggest tax breaks in history to the super-wealthy and raise taxes on the middle class.  We can't afford that.
Think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone who lashes out at anyone who challenges him.
