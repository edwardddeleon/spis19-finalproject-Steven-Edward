"9. BTW, I'm old enough to remember when Barack Obama told a black audience he would see it as a ""personal insult, an insult to my legacy"" if black Americans didn't show up to vote for Hillary in 2016. Which sounds a lot like a call for personal loyalty to a specific ethnic group."
8. — and blamed the Jewish state for stopping that — now suddenly rediscovering anti-Semitism as soon as Trump's name arises. You're not fighting anti-Semitism if you're not calling it out on all sides.
7. It's incredible and disgusting to watch the same media firefighters who steadfastly ignored Omar and Tlaib trying to tour Israel with a group that pushed the blood libel —
"6. Trump's ""King of the Jews"" comments are completely and utterly insane."
"5. It's utterly unclear if Trump's ""disloyalty"" comments suggest (2) or (3), which would be anti-Semitic, or (4), which would be impolitic from a non-Jew, but true."
4. Jewish belief and practice SHOULD make it more difficult to vote for a party that celebrates and champions Jew-haters like Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar.
"3. American Jews, whether ethnic or religious, are loyal to America, not Israel. Any dual loyalty supposition is anti-Semitism."
"2. Those born Jewish don't have to have political ""loyalties"" in any direction. That's pure identity politics. Such a supposition is no different or better than Ayanna Pressley saying ""we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice."""

The people of Greenland will greet us as liberators.
And the Israeli government points out that the groups sponsoring Omar and Tlaib have terror connections.
Probably to create an issue. That’s what Twitter exists to do.
"Good info! Also, that tweet is eight years old."
"If you oppose the United States buying Greenland, you hate America."
"If you don't believe in media bias, examine how the media have largely decided to start using the term ""racist"" to describe Trump's comments but spin wildly to avoid using the term ""anti-Semitic"" to describe Tlaib's and Omar's."
"Use some nuance, bro. It’s morally justified but a bad PR move."
It gives the Democrats the excuse to rally around Omar and Tlaib. That may help Trump domestically but it’s quite bad for Israel.
All are true: 1. Israel does allow critics in the country.  2. Israel does not allow those who call for its boycott and/or destruction into the country. 3. (2) is justified. 4. Omar and Tlaib fall under (2). 5. It's still a PR mistake for Israel to hand this kind of club to them.
"Well, it wasn't a mistake. They know exactly what they were saying, and it was purposeful."
That's pretty much the story ;)
"Again, I'm not doubting that! My quote was a direct response to Kamala Harris' statement that no one should have to work multiple jobs, which is a statement about restructuring markets."
There are a lot of reasons why people work multiple jobs. I discuss it in the segment. The point I was making was a DIRECT response to Kamala Harris suggesting no one should have to do so. Restructuring the economy to meet that goal is idiocy.
"And by the way, I have worked multiple jobs for most of my career."
This is perfectly clear in context; the comment immediately follows a line from Kamala Harris claiming that no one should have to work two jobs.
"The answer to the problem of taking a job that you feel underpays you is to (a) not take the job, as I suggest here, or (b) not live beyond your means. It is not to restructure the economy in line with your utopian view of what you deserve from others."
Absolute sheer nonsense.

"The overlap is significant in one direction. Meaning a lot of white supremacists like zero tolerance at the border, but the huge majority of those who like zero tolerance aren’t white supremacists."

Bernie has heretofore come the closest to the gut answer: we'll just do it! By shouting! But Williamson gave a different answer: we'll spiritually transform America. It was actually somewhat Obama-esque in approach.
"None of the radicals were capable of answering a simple question: how would you implement your proposals? And how do you propose to convince Americans to, e.g., give up their health care plans?"
"There's a reason Williamson had a big night tonight. Moderates (Delaney, Hickenlooper, Ryan, Klobuchar) shredded radicals (Warren, Bernie, Buttigieg) on policy. And the main pitch for radicalism isn't policy realism or success. It's spiritual. Williamson is filling that gap."

"1. Trump doesn't have a serious plan for Baltimore. 2. Trump rips his opponents with whatever club is available. 3. Baltimore is indeed a horribly-run city with terrible problems, including rat infestation and poverty and crime. 4. Saying 3 is not racist."
"There's a trick I use to feed my three-year-old. It goes like this:  ""Don't eat that! Don't eat it!""  He then eats his food. Trump elicits a similar response from Democrats and the media.  ""Baltimore is a bad place to live!"" ""NO, IT'S THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD, RACIST!"""
*Blasio
Hence my criticism that his ragetweeting is bad. But the tweets still aren’t racist. See his tweets about Bill De Blaise.
"Trump’s pajamas rage-tweeting is bad for the country. But pointing out that Baltimore is one of the worst run cities in America, rife with crime and plagued by poor living conditions, isn’t racist. It’s evident to anyone with two eyes and a functioning pre-frontal cortex."

"Democrats seem to want to shout about how important climate change is, provide no serious solutions, and then focus on some Republicans' denial of climate change's importance and EVERYONE'S unwillingness to endorse the stupidity of the GND. That's cynical, not virtuous."
"Several things can be true at once: (1) Climate change is real; (2) There are no good solutions to preventing it, stymied only by ""denial""; (3) Failing to acknowledge (2) is a deliberate and divisive strategy that is both counterproductive overall and politically advantageous."
"In other words, Democrats would rather shout about ""climate deniers"" and the policy-free ""Green New Deal"" than present a solution, since they don't have one. That's solid politicking. It's also wildly divisive and unproductive."

"With the Democratic Party largely regretful at Franken’s ouster, and Mayer – the lead purveyor of the supposed new standard, who went after Brett Kavanaugh using skimpy to no evidence – in the lead, it seems that the entire Franken event was more cynical than sincere."
"The same thing was true of the newfound horror at Bill Clinton’s late-1990s scandals among Democrats. Were Democrats realizing their error, or simply re-writing the rules in retrospect to target Trump?"
"When Franken was ousted, it could be viewed as one of two things: (1) a sincere attempt at re-setting a standard on sexual behavior; (2) a cynical attempt by some Democrats to club Trump by supposedly re-setting the standard they had ignored when Clinton was in the crosshairs."

"No policy necessarily *has* to result in anything. The question is whether it was predictable that it would, and whether the policy would achieve its goals. The results were fully predictable, and they were not good."
"Harris will never answer this question, because she knows it's political poison. She understands that forced busing resulted in white flight, which in turn led to more de facto racial separation than before, devastating local tax bases and local public schools."
Harris has vaguely suggested that she'd consider forced busing as a strategy. She's essentially suggested that Biden is a racist for opposing it. So let's hear her plan. Is she suggesting widespread forced busing of children in the public schools? cc: @KamalaHarris

Bernie: We will have Medicare for All by yelling about it! That's how we'll do it! CIVIL RIGHTS! BLARGHABARAHSBA
Marianne Williamson is conducting a seance offscreen.
The questioners tonight are REALLY smacking around Bernie. No one else receiving treatment anywhere near as tough.
"So far, Buttigieg and Harris looking good. Sanders looking combative. Biden looking old."
"Why is Kirsten Gillibrand getting so much time? Perhaps because all sides of every issue should be heard, and she represents all of them."
Harris reverses herself AGAIN. So she started off by saying she'd abolish private health care plans. Then she reversed herself. She just raised her hand to abolish them again.
"""America does not want to witness a food fight, they just want to know how we're going to put food on their table!"" That line is terrible, but got a large cheer. Harris brought along her cheering section tonight."
LOUD NOISES
Swalwell calls Biden old. Biden tries to avoid the hit by saying he's still holding on to the torch. Unreal that he didn't have a pre-written one-off joke there.
This debate is so fragmentary and discombobulated.
"Hey look, I'm on TV! Oh no, that's just Eric Swalwell. We are all Eric Swalwell."
"Hey look, @andrewyang!"
"Buttigieg breaks out the Spanish. This means that according to Article XXXVI of the Constitution, he and Beto and Booker are now the only legitimate Democratic candidates."
"Yes, he is better than the others. Also, he has no shot, and is thus irrelevant."
"Bennet spaces out, then realizes they're talking about him. Yeah, we're all bored, too."
Why is this random man yelling at me about Colorado?
Sanders stumbling. Biden mumbling. Harris looking strong out of the gate.
"Agree, of course. Just comparing the campaigns not the men."
Although I do look forward to Bernie Sanders playing the wind chimes while singing the Internationale.
"These debates are the worst version of a beauty pageant. Tonight, Pete Buttigieg will play piano and read poetry in Norwegian, then explain that he most wishes for world peace."
Beto 2020 is Jeb! 2016. Discuss.
"This debate is making all the Democrats look small. Trump, like him or not, is anything but small as a character. That’s a problem for them."
That technical snafu was far better than anything said tonight.
Wait until Warren starts speaking Cherokee.
Democrats now in an abortion auction. First person to endorse post-birth infanticide wins.
#partyofscience
So glad Castro just clarified that biological men must be granted abortion rights.
Really enjoying Question Time with Elizabeth Warren.
Remember that time Beto was the most amazing politician in history until he suddenly wasn’t running against Ted Cruz?
Second night! I am Eric Swalwell. We have had this conversation before.
"I'll be honest, I'm rooting for @AndrewYang"
"Him: ""Yo, ho, yo, ho"" Her: ""I want a divorce."""
Can't believe he ghosted her
Ex marks the spot
This will be a real black spot for her
Turns out she was a gold digger
What a haunting tale
Turns out she was a landlubber
There was a storm a-brewin'
"He'd testify against her, but dead men tell no tales"
He was disappointed in the booty
She'll be taking half the treasure
She wasn't his soul matey
"Mickey Mantle, Bo Jackson, Sandy Koufax"
“Stop the Nazis!” sure morphed into “Everyone I don’t like is a dog-whistling Nazi!” pretty damned quickly.
"I’m mostly confused by who exactly is in the IDW now. As one of the three members on stage when Eric coined the term (along with Sam Harris), I’m just wondering who hands out the membership cards and why they suddenly get to define its end or character."
"You didn’t come to the Friday night synagogue meeting. Not only are you out, I’ve set a hurricane to hit your house."
"Man, am I a sucker for paying off my law school debt, my wife's tuition, and her medical school debt. I should have just waited for Bernie to fix it."
"I bought a house. I have been responsibly paying the mortgage. I don't want to. Also, I have a credit card, and I pay it off in timely fashion. I don't want to. #CancelAllDebt #EconomicFreedom"
"So, keep quiet about your strategy, or make consequences clear and obvious to everyone. Setting up vague standards, or blustering without credibility is the worst of all possible worlds."
(1) No one wants war with Iran. (2) Deterrence is a valuable strategy in both preventing full-scale war and curbing aggression. (3) Deterrence requires the credible threat of disproportionate force. (4) Confusion and vacillation undermine deterrence.
"I thought that was strongly implied, but yep."
Interesting to watch Republicans embrace Bill Clinton’s foreign policy with regard to terrorism.
"Guys, don’t take my head off for this. That’s OJ’s job."
This is correct!
This does not go for her follow-up tweets. It's just a reference to the first tweet.
Bipartisan agreement is so wonderful. cc: Joe Biden
I think we can all acknowledge that Jerry Orbach was the best.
"Jane, we agree far more than you let on. For example, we both know that 1776 is superior to Hamilton, even if you will never publicly admit it."
"If you want to know why conservatives don’t trust the media, compare their treatment of AOC to their treatment of Trump. Both say ridiculous and false things regularly. One is rabidly defended by our journalistic firefighting brigade. The other is called a Hitlerian liar."
It’s going to be amazing when AOC declares that the earth is flat and the media rush to explain why she is right and it’s all Trump’s fault.
Many of the same people who shrug off Iran’s and Hamas’ genocidal ambitions against Jews while calling for boycotts against the Jewish state of Israel are saying that temporary detention of illegal immigrants is akin to the Holocaust.
The ACKSHUALLYs from the media over AOC’s obvious reference to the Holocaust are breathtaking in both their generosity and dishonesty.
"Guys, when AOC said concentration camp, she honestly just meant a camp where people concentrate. Never again!"
"No, he wasn't. But the others were."
"It depends on the crime - I wouldn’t equate child rape or murder with saying a racist thing, e.g., but I’m all in favor of charging minors differently than adults generally."
I was most assuredly not joking.
"*Plus Andrew Yang, the only person on the stage who has ideas different from the rest."

This is the modern Kobayashi Maru problem.
"The night Swalwell is on, of course."
"In short, this isn’t legally cut and dry. It’s morally reprehensible, but it’s not necessarily illegal - it’s not at all clear that the statute covers information. If it did, it would create all sorts of serious First Amendment issues."
And Christopher Steele is a foreign national who also happens to be a non-resident alien.
Trump met the Prince of Whales? So glad he finally sat down with John McAfee.
Happy bday! ;)
"I also enjoy ""Summer Stock."""

Watching @scrowder get waterboarded was a Christmas miracle.
"I swear, every time I sign off for a Jewish holiday, the @nytimes drops some sort of idiotic hit piece. I'm back now, and suffice it to say, the piece is so fully nonsensical that it lumps in me, @jordanbpeterson, @RubinReport and Milton Friedman with actual alt-right YouTubers."
"For those who are saying they’ll wait for the details, fair enough; you’re right that I’m assuming this is some form of the deal WaPo reported last night."
The tariffs don’t go into effect and Mexico devotes more resources to stopping illegal immigration. Why isn’t that a win?
Yup! See my twitter feed.
"Your company is openly pressuring YouTube to change its standards, not abiding by a rule of respect for their decisions. As you know."
"See, e.g., Chick-Fil-A -- or, on the Left, see Nike. The best way to stop this vicious cycle is for those with the power (advertisers and platforms) to simply refuse to play this idiotic game. /END"
"It would work, and all this nonsense would end. Because here's the truth: not one of these astroturfed boycotts by pseudojournalists has ever resulted in serious financial damage for an advertiser or platform. Not one. Often, the publicity has resulted in BIGGER revenue."
"You know how this all stops? By advertisers and platforms just saying ""no."" That's all it takes. All they have to do is say that they don't agree with or even like all the stuff they advertise on or that is posted, but they endorse open platforms and differences of opinion."
"They're not policing the public square for bad actors. They're policing it for conservatives, and then using whatever brickbat is available to club advertisers -- and the shows that benefit from advertising revenue -- into submission."
"It's the reason they won't call advertisers for Joy Reid to ask whether they will continue to advertise on her show, but they will reliably call advertisers for @IngrahamAngle and @TuckerCarlson for comment on their nightly programs. It's all a gross attempt to shut down voices."
"These pseudojournalists know full well that advertisers don't endorse every message on every program upon which they advertise. But they manufacture the specter of secondary boycotts that never take place to frighten advertisers into submission. It's disgusting, and it's common."
"This applies to @voxdotcom, @HuffPost, @buzzfeednews and a wide variety of other pseudo-journalistic entities that see it as their mission to destroy the profit motive for conservative shows by attacking advertisers who advertise on a wide variety of programming."
"Re: that absurd @voxdotcom letter calling on YouTube to deplatform @scrowder, advertisers should also note that Media Matters-style activists masquerading as journalists who call advertisers for comment on conservatives aren't interested in a story. They're astroturfing boycotts."
"Jane, you know I appreciate a lot of your writing. As you also know, I think you're too good for @voxdotcom. If you wish to keep taking checks from people who openly call for censorship on social media for those who hurt the feelings of their employees, that's a you call."
.@voxdotcom is now Media Matters with a veneer of journalism. Take that into account when reading their stuff.
"Agree, of course!"
"No actor has ever had a better year than Thomas Mitchell had in 1939. He was in ""Only Angels Have Wings,"" ""Stagecoach,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" and ""Gone With The Wind."" In one year."
75 years ago: young Americans braved Nazi fire on beaches to liberate a continent and defend Constitutional rights. Today: young Americans whine about people making mean jokes about them on YouTube and demand censorship.
"This is essentially @YouTube admitting that they exercised the heckler's veto. They can't point to how @scrowder broke their rules, so they just made up new rules based on the fact that a bunch of people whined to them."
No. I'm saying that fats don't care about your feelings.
"If you didn't want it that way, Bridget, you shouldn't have eaten the sheet cakes."
"All, please feel free to reply with your favorite instances of those on the political Left engaging in harmful stereotypes, group judgments, or insulting language on @YouTube."
It's far more dangerous to the country and the discourse to work to shut down the entire public square on behalf of your feelings than it is that people sometimes call you mean names. Grow the f*** up.
"If you're in the public eye, you're going to be mocked and insulted in ways you find deplorable. If your solution is to target the platform for destruction -- or to target advertisers who advertise on a wide variety of political programming -- you're the actual problem."
"If @YouTube is now going to police insulting speech -- not violent speech, not incitement, not actual fake news -- because a virulently censorious, radical activist masquerading as a journalist complains about being insulted, they're a joke."
"""Black Mirror"" spoiler alert: it's all virtual reality. This spoiler applies to 82% of all episodes."
You may disagree with @DavidAFrench’s approach to politics. But to suggest that he is somehow insufficiently committed to conservative ideas and values is simply incompatible with reality.
You bet (although I'll continue to disagree with you on the senator ;) ). Would be happy to have you on the Sunday Special to talk about it. It's truly incredible work.
"Regardless of what I think of @clmazin's politics, #Chernobyl is a masterpiece, and he deserves enormous praise for a truly stunning work."
Beto!
"Thanks for the heads up. That's pretty conservative stuff, imho. I mean, really, really pure conservatism, straight up, snorting lines of conservatism."
"Dude, would LOVE to have @OzzieGuillen on my Sunday Special for an hour - my favorite player, favorite manager. Awesome!"
"BTW, it's pretty awesome that Stallone is still doing this at age 72."
Come on out to LA!
Benioff and Weiss really blew the final episode of “Mueller.”
"I think that's correct. But it's not quite ""he'd be prosecutable but for the OLC opinion,"" which was your synopsis. I think that it's pretty obvious Mueller would love to see Congress go after Trump, but that's not a prosecutorial standard, it's a political one."
Shorter Mueller: I wrote a giant report. Go read it. Stop asking me to solve all your problems. Bbye.
#NeverWave
"I'm not sure that's exactly right. He's saying he MIGHT be prosecuted, but OLC prevented it. Saying that he didn't clear the president isn't saying he'd prosecute. So basically, we're exactly where we were five minutes ago -- though Mueller is pretty damning of Trump's behavior."
"With that said, Mueller's statement is far more damning toward the president than Barr's initial report -- which makes total sense, given the content of the report vs. the legal determination on whether to prosecute."
"This means that the OLC opinion was used as a threshold that allowed Mueller not to make a determination on obstruction; it's possible that both Mueller and Barr are telling the truth, in other words. If Mueller wanted to say Trump would be indicted but for OLC, he could have."
"Barr said that Mueller told him ""several times in a group meeting that he was not saying that but for the OLC opinion he would have found obstruction."" This isn't quite opposed to Mueller's statement today -- Mueller says he didn't have to find on obstruction thanks to OLC."
"""If we had confidence that the president did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" That is not the standard of a prosecutor. Prosecutors exist to determine whether someone committed a chargeable offense, not whether they are exonerated of charges."
And a double. Wow!
He’s hit the ball right on the nose twice! Awesome debut!
I’ve also spent years smacking down the alt-right. Three weeks ago the FBI arrested a white supremacist who had been sending death threats to me.
We all owe a debt to those who have fallen for our freedom - a debt we can never repay. May we be worthy of their sacrifice; they knew our freedoms certainly were. #MemorialDay
“John Wick 3” may be the greatest film since “Citizen Kane.” Probably not. But maybe.
"Email me! bshapiro@dailywire.com  Or alternatively, I'll spare myself the humiliation and just cut a check ;)"
Tell them I say hi
"Then start one and apply for federal aid. As policy is currently constituted, adoption agency B will shutter (as happened with Catholic adoption agencies in Massachusetts)."
So now your argument is that existing adoption agencies with whom you disagree should be defunded in order to promote social policy you favor. Not sure how that results in more adoptions.
"If agency A is funded and allows same-sex adoption, and agency B is now also funded and does not, how are you disadvantaged?"
It does not shut down or defund existing agencies that adopt to same-sex couples.
"This does not mean that Trump is smart to engage in the CrazyFight with Pelosi, as I've already tweeted. It is noting that this headline is borderline dishonest."
"Here's the problem with Trump having a ""YOU'RE CRAZY!"" fight with Pelosi. Pelosi is elected by a single district centered in San Francisco. Trump must be re-elected by the entire country. The only winning move for Trump is not to play, and she is successfully baiting him."
"Yes, @LGio27! An amazing performance for my #whitesox"
"You're exactly the same as always, Bridget."
The infrastructure was in our hearts.
"Guys, Infrastructure Week isn't about infrastructure. It's about the friends we made along the way."
"I couldn't be more pleased about the outcome of this Infrastructure Week. No trillion dollars spent on government boondoggles, AND high school drama over impeachment?! Sign me up!"
I.e. What policy prescriptions are designed to tackle the risk? What is their cost? Do we follow Nordhaus here?
"I agree with a good deal of this, but it provides no guidance as to what the cost half of the risk/cost equation looks like on the policy end."
"I have long said that addiction is an illness, but that willingness to engage in the first place was a personal choice as a general rule (but not a universal rule)."
"Yes, but the heroin addict is now affecting people other than the heroin addict."
"I don’t think it is terrible or wrong to be concerned about those affected by the externalities of homelessness, not just the interests of the homeless."
I’m confused as to why it is illegitimate for people in every area not to want to trip over heroin addicts in front of their residences.
"I’m for more building of housing, as per Utah; I’m for more mental health funding. But without the power to compel people to even move, or the power to temporarily institutionalize the seriously mentally ill, all the social workers in the world aren’t going to do diddly."
Then let’s hear some alternatives. Because blaming residents of major cities for calling the cops when they trip over a heroin addict shooting up in the doorway of their business seems unproductive to me.
That is true - police aren’t the permanent solution - but police are the first point of contact. And that point of contact has been stopped.
"Not “whatever they want.” Stopped from being able to move people who are trespassing and loitering, from being able to remove stolen shopping carts filled with trash, from being able to prevent hazardous permanent settlement on public streets."
“This stew really reminds me of my grandma.”

"""bbbbbbut she's my queen!"" he cried after she murdered a million people. Also, he's sent back to the Night's Watch against his will and his lineage is played for zero effect."
To fix the season only required four things: 1. Arya changing faces to kill the Night King; 2. Bran doing something to help kill the Night King; 3. Something setting Dany off; 4. Jon becoming king and then abdicating in favor of Bran.
"That's all fine. I like Ned as well as the next guy. But GIANT fail. Jon was reduced to a quivering, pathetic figure. Bran is terrible."
"Bran: “I’m not the Lord of Winterfell.” Tyrion: “You don’t want it?” Bran: “I don’t really ‘want’ anymore.”  Fast forward...  Tyrion: “If we choose you, will you wear the crown?” Bran: “Why do you think I came all this way?”  I'm telling you, he's evil. #GameOfThrones"
✔Lets millions burn in King’s Landing ✔Accepts the crown but lets the true heir get banished to the north even after the unsullied leave ✔Lets his sister go independent but keeps Asha under his thumb ✔Lets the council handle sewage and military while he puffs the magic dragon
My version of Jar Jar was a Sith is Bran was the most evil person in Westeros. ✔Abandons Rickon ✔Gets Hodor killed ✔Does nothing during the Battle of Winterfell while watching thousands get smoked  ✔Tells Jon about his lineage but not about Dany being genocidal
My current theory is that Bran is the most evil person on the show.
So if Bran knew the future the whole time wasn’t he just complicit in the murder of a million people in King’s Landing?
Remember that time that Jon was the true heir and it meant nothing?
"Council: Okay, King Bran, we need to rebuild the fleet and the military, and create a sewage system. Bran: Sounds like you got this. I’m gonna be over here puffing the magic dragon."
*to be satisfying
You can’t turn Jon into a passive character in his own story and expect it to few satisfying.
"The final episode was fine, except that they robbed Jon Snow of agency. Imagine after he kills Dany, he hops on the dragon, the unsullied rush the stairs, and Jon is ready to roast them. Fade to black. The rest is the same except Jon turns down the throne."
"Btw, the next queen will be Sansa. She will have an independent army, she is Bran’s closest relative, Tyrion is still her legal husband, and half the votes on the council are her direct relatives. #gameofthrones"
"Or someone who did something for, you know, an episode."
Or Olenna Tyrell.
Or Tywin.
Robb should have been king. #gameofthrones
"What if Bran was actually the most evil person on the show? He uses the threat of the Night King to knock off a couple of Dany’s dragons, then randomly spills Jon’s lineage just in time to prevent a happy ending and precipitate Dany going nuts and Jon killing her. Boom, king!"
"Arya becomes Columbus. The only person who plays her cards right is Sansa. Tyrion now has to work for Bran, which sounds like a crap job."
Question: was Jon’s lineage of any importance at all?
"So Bran becomes king thanks to doing LITERALLY NOTHING FOR YEARS. It was a bold move Cotton, but it paid off for him. #GameOfThrones"
It’s coming!
"I've had a similar experience with Mayor Pete. I invited him on the show publicly, and he expressed interest a few months back via Twitter. Since then, there's been no response from his team after the blowback to his tweet."
Tell it to Knowles.

Maybe Bill De Blasio wants to be president so he doesn't have to live in New York anymore. Their mayor is just terrible.

Was John Wick 3 good? That is now the only thing worth caring about.
"As far as the Voting Rights Act, it was excellent when promulgated, but attempts to stretch the application of the VRA beyond the point of salience now is a problem."
Would be happy to do so! I've expressed them many times. Short take: the vast majority of the Civil Rights Act is good; I am opposed to the public accommodations provisions that interfere in private business rather than aimed at overriding state discrimination.
"Life is a right. In fact, unlike abortion, which is not a right, life is specified directly in the Declaration of Independence, as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and remains the most fundamental right of all. #AbortionIsAWomansRight"
Um agree!
"Pretty hopeful for a worst case scenario. Here's another scenario: law quickly struck down, no cert for Roe, pro-abortion movement chalks up a victory and pushes hard on PR. Or worse, SCOTUS takes it up, reinforces Roe in such a way as to prevent further narrowing of Casey."
"The law probably won't go into effect, however; this will immediately be appealed to a federal court, which will likely strike it down, no?"
"This means that the likely result of the Alabama bill is that it is struck down and never goes into effect, and has the opposite of its intended effect in the public discussion. William Lloyd Garrison was correct, but it took Lincoln to end slavery."
"Two things can be true at once:  1. The Alabama bill is morally correct; 2. The Alabama bill is a strategic mistake, given the fact that the Supreme Court will not overrule Roe."
He also used to be dead. He is not anymore.
Running the kingdom is left to each individual province. Sansa in the north and the Vale; Gendry in Storm's End; Asha in the Iron Islands; Bronn in the Reach; Tyrion in the Westerlands; the unnamed prince of Dorne in Dorne.
"Prediction: Jon goes to kill Dany in the final episode, and she unleashes the dragon on him. He doesn't burn, because he's Targaryen. He then kills her -- he pulls a sword from the flame, as per the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy -- but is too broken to take the throne."
"BTW, the comments on this video are gold."
"George RR Martin doesn't get to whine about how HBO ends the series. He's the one who has spent the last two centuries completing his series (and btw, everything beyond book three isn't very good)."
LOL
"The Euron fight was unnecessary. Grey Worm’s turn was bizarre. But here’s where the episode went right: Tyrion and Jon were completely exposed as fools, which they have been."
"Jamie’s story arc was completely eviscerated. Cersei’s strategy was defeated immediately, making her development as a leader moot as well."
"Now, here are my problems, biggest one first: why would Dany turn on the people this way? We all suspected she’d turn, but going full genocidal maniac after a surrender for no reason is too much."
"That episode of #gameofthrones was, overall, great. Unexpected deaths, some fan service, and a pretty spectacular turn that exposes Jon and Tyrion as much as Dany."

"To close, contrast two videos. The first is a video from Yom Hashoah - Holocaust Remembrance Day - of Jews aboard an El Al flight to Israel. The plane is flying above Germany, and the pilot is explaining that all of his grandparents died in the camps."
Spare me the crocodile tears about Chabad of Poway or Tree of Life if you’re now making excuses for Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
"By and large, the Jeremy Corbyn Left, the New York Times editorial board, the sophisticates at western universities treat Jew-hatred differently based on the source of the Jew-hatred. Which means Jewish blood is a political tool for them, not a problem."
"If you consider it morally abhorrent for a white supremacist terrorist to target Jews for death, you should consider Hamas and Islamic Jihad the same way. Yet many do not, which certainly speaks to their lack of seriousness about Jew-hatred."
Israel is being attacked by terrorists firing hundreds of rockets at civilian areas. The terrorists care so little about their own citizens that their rockets hit their own people. Israel is retaliating by specifically targeting terrorists. Yet the world draws moral equivalence.
"The report demonstrates dishonesty, bad judgment. It doesn’t clear the president of those things. But there is no prosecutable behavior, and thus Americans aren’t into impeachment."
