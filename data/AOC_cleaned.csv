"5) The Electoral College isn’t about fairness at all; it’s about empowering some voters over others.  Every vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from. The right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. & GOP will do everything they can to fight it."
4) We do not give electoral affirmative action to any other group in America. Do Black Americans have their votes count more bc they have been disenfranchised for 100s of years? Do Reservations get an electoral vote? Does Puerto Rico and US territories get them? No. They don’t.
"3) LASTLY, this concept that the Electoral College is provides “fairness” to rural Americans over coastal states doesn’t hold any water whatsoever. First of all, virtually every state has rural communities. NY. California. Much of our states are rural.  But very importantly..."
"2) This common claim about “if we don’t have the Electoral College then a handful of states will determine the presidency” is BS.  a. It’s the *EC itself* that breaks down power by state, pop vote decentralizes it   b. The EC makes it so a handful of states DO determine elections"
"I see Fox News is big mad about abolishing the electoral college.  So let’s talk about it.  1) If the GOP were the “silent majority” they claim, they wouldn’t be so scared of a popular vote.  They *know* they aren’t the majority. They rely on establishing minority rule for power."

"But it is incredibly important that we recognize that perfectly normal, good people are capable of aiding racism & white supremacy.  Recognizing that is not about pillorying people. It’s about learning to recognize *the virus* & end an oppressive system designed to hurt us *all.*"
"What this moment is asking of us is to discuss *white supremacy and racism* as much - or possibly more than - *white supremacists and racists.*  When we do that, I believe we will start to make progress."
"Recognizing white supremacy in ourselves - our institutions, our subconscious, our own past remarks or acts (no matter how consciously unintentional), is what makes the healing work ahead challenging.   But it is not impossible,and confronting it is the only way to move forward."
"Perhaps more than the obvious last steps of the supremacist,we must examine the nuance of their first steps.  That is a painful inquiry, bc for many, we may see familiarity in those first steps. And that familiarity is very difficult to see + admit. We’d rather not talk about it."
"Healing ourselves of white supremacy will be hard. It will be hard because it requires us to confront *ourselves.*  We wish it was as simple as denouncing a white hood, a burnt cross, vile language. But we need to address where supremacy *begins,* not just where it ends."
"White supremacy is often subconscious. & Clearly, our nation has not been inoculated. WS is our nation’s original sin;the driving logic of slavery, of Native genocide, of Jim Crow, of segregation, of mass incarceration,of “Send Her Back.”  It never went away. It was just dormant."
"There is a difference between white supremacists & white supremacy.  White supremacy is like a virus.   Supremacists are those who have been completely overcome by the disease, but supremacy - the virus - exists on a larger scale beyond just the infected. It also lays dormant."

"The reason there’s a tendency to “both sides” every issue on TV is bc the medium is incentivized for conflict, so ppl will put the least qualified people on TV to create it (see: climate deniers). Don’t ask “is [blank] racist?” Have experts explain what to do about racism.  /2"
"If I were a journalist/worked in news, this is what I’d do rn:  1. Interview actual experts on white supremacy & give them space (more than 2mins or lines) to educate the public on WS, what to look for. Often.  2. Not frame white supremacy&racism as a “conflict” or “debate”... /1"

"Are CBP officers waking up women in the middle of sleep a “funding” problem?  Is calling migrants “filthy” “wh*res” a funding problem?  Is threatening violence on members of Congress a “funding” problem?  No, it’s not. It’s a far deeper, systemic, more violent problem than that."
"When you pair: - 9,500 current + former CBP officers are part of a violently racist & sexually violent secret Facebook group - Corroborating accounts of abuse - CBP couldn’t control their own officers for a Congressional tour  What else do you call that but a rogue agency?"
"And to these CBP officers saying they felt “threatened” by me -  They were literally discussing making a GoFundMe for an officer who attacked my on my tour.  They confiscated my phone, and they were all armed. I’m 5’4”.  They’re just upset I exposed their inhumane behavior."
"What’s haunting is that the women I met with today told me in no uncertain terms that they would experience retribution for telling us what they shared.  They all began sobbing - out of fear of being punished, out of sickness, out of desperation, lack of sleep, trauma, despair."

"After I forced myself into a cell w/ women&began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as “psychological warfare” - waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc.  Tell me what about that is due to a “lack of funding?”"
"Now I’ve seen the inside of these facilities.  It’s not just the kids. It’s everyone. People drinking out of toilets, officers laughing in front of members Congress.  I brought it up to their superiors. They said “officers are under stress & act out sometimes.” No accountability."
Just left the 1st CBP facility.  I see why CBP officers were being so physically &sexually threatening towards me.  Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets.  This was them on their GOOD behavior in front of members of Congress.
"9,500 CBP officers sharing memes about dead migrants and discussing violence and sexual misconduct towards members of Congress.  How on earth can CBP’s culture be trusted to care for refugees humanely?  PS I have no plans to change my itinerary & will visit the CBP station today."

"But of course, just because a statute is abolished doesn’t mean the unfairness is gone. Remaining are life & death implications of other statutes & *how* laws are enforced.  That’s a key part of policy in a wide range of issues from schooling to marijuana + yes, immigration too."
Dred Scott was the landmark Supreme Court case that found the US Constitution didn’t give citizenship to black people.  The 1st US immigration law was the Chinese Exclusion Act. It was a race-based policy that was upheld until 1942.  The “National Origins Formula” lasted til ‘65.
"The history of Citizenship in the US is deeply woven with the history of racism. It has been used as the legal enforcer of racism for most of US history.  Citizenship affords power, & that’s why citizenship of African Americans was long denied too - to both slaves & descendants."

Gotta love the rich irony of people who fondly recount stories of how their family’s last names were changed on Ellis Island after their relatives snuck onto a boat escaping some horror now taking fervent anti-immigrant stances & branding innocent human beings as “illegal.”
"One narrative in this country that we need to turn on its head is the lie that immigrants are “takers,” or represent a weight on society.  It’s wrong. Immigrants are *makers.* They create+offer opportunity. They aren’t a weight to carry; in fact, they are our nation’s shoulders."
"It’s worked in recent history, btw - which is why they keep doing it. It got Dems to kill the public option years ago (imagine the last decade w a public option!)  I *wish* the party was as bold as GOP accuses. We’d win more, imo."
We have time. We can stay in town. We can at LEAST add some amendments to this Senate bill. But to pass it completely unamended with no House input? That seems a bridge too far.
"0 negotiation with the House. We offered crucial amendments to protect children and families - none are even being considered.  A minority is different than a majority. And while the Senate has to deal with its lack of power there, a House majority should have a seat @ the table."
"0 conferencing with House Dems. 0 amendments accepted - including CRUCIAL amendments that would prevent more suffering.  There is enormous frustration here with the capitulation of the Senate minority. But that aside, we have a majority in the House and need to use it."
Under no circumstances should the House vote for a McConnell-only bill w/ no negotiation with Democrats. Hell no.  That’s an abdication of power we should refuse to accept. They will keep hurting kids if we do.
"This President will not lift a finger to save these kids.  It is well within his power, but he & Mitch McConnell would rather cast blame than do anything.  They need to get on board w/ a clean humanitarian bill. We can’t write no-strings blank checks to abusive facilities."
"In meeting I asked “Why can the president take money from other agencies to build his little wall, but can’t move money to get kids toothpaste?”  It’s bc his “nat’l emergency” is ONLY to build his wall.  But he won’t declare an emergency to save these kids & get them help."
"His Senate bill is a militarization bill. McConnell killed the House Bill & dropped this one right before recess to force passage.  Well, too bad. This is our job. Cancel vacation, fly the Senate in. Pass a clean humanitarian bill & stop trying to squeeze crises for more pain."
"Reminder: the member who directly + explicitly compared concentration camps on our border to the Holocaust was *Liz Cheney.*  The horrors of the Holocaust went beyond the use of concentration camps, yet camps were part of the process.  They have also been used before and after."
"I have absolutely zero patience for completely certified, card-carrying and flag-waving racists. None. 🚫   They can take their little tiki torches somewhere else.  We don’t give them an inch, a second, a sliver of sunlight nor the time of day. And neither should you."

"Reminder this admin is CHOOSING to round up refugees seeking asylum, fighting to not give children toothpaste or soap & making people sleep on dirt floors.  They say it’s bc of a lack of 💰. You know what saves money? Not putting masses of people in internment in the first place."
This President needs to be impeached.
"For folks saying we should gloss over this, I think it’s important to realize that we can’t risk depressed turnout in 2020.  The original remark is valid to ask about & have a discussion on or clarify - not dismiss.  We should be compassionate toward each other, but not silent."
We are calling these camps what they are because they fit squarely in an academic consensus and definition.  History will be kind to those who stood up to this injustice.  So say what you will. Kids are dying and I’m not here to make people feel comfortable about that.
"My heroes are the ones who stood up when it wasn’t easy.  Kids are dying in cages on our border. Families are being put in “freezers” & “dog pounds.”  Years from now, people will look for the journalists, officials, & everyday people who stood up for what was right in real-time."
"What’s worse, Congress has asked DHS for documents on the whereabouts of children taken from their parents.  We‘ve asked for details & records on camp conditions.  DHS has refused to cooperate or provide Congress w/ the requested information.  Why doesn’t that concern @HouseGOP?"
Someone didn’t go to my Twitter class
Not one dime should go to DHS for building these camps as they detain children & families.  Congressional appropriations season is now. That means it’s 💰 time - we‘re voting to fund federal government programs.  We should not fund the caging of kids & families. Pretty simple.
And for the shrieking Republicans who don’t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps.  Concentration camps are considered by experts as “the mass detention of civilians without trial.”  And that’s exactly what this administration is doing.
"Concentration camps are not the same as death camps.  This is an important distinction. One of the biggest lessons from that dark history is that it didn’t happen overnight. It emerged out of slow, increasingly concerning steps that acclimated the public to inhumane treatment."

"It’s not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important.  ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That’s why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too.  Voting against cost of living increases is 1 reason why dark $ loopholes stay open."
"What this does is punish members who rely on a straight salary, and reward those who rely on money loopholes and other forms of self-dealing.  For example, it incentivizes the horrible kinds of legislative looting we saw in the GOP tax scam bill."
I think a lot about the policies I support through the lens of family:  - Ending the war on drugs helps keep families together - A living wage + strong worker protections frees parents to invest more time w/ their kids - Healthcare for all ensures parents + babies are healthier

"(I do want to say that while there was some real intense BS at times, the people I worked with there were incredible. I made close, trusted friendships that I still have to this day✨ being in the weeds with people day and day out can create incredible bonds)"
"Some people have brought up Congressional dorms - certainly a possibility.  This does happen informally; lots of members live in the same building/apt. Key to any solution (dorm, stipend, w/e) is compatibility w family/spouse- many work overtime, unrecognized, to support members."
"There are plenty of examples. Another big one is spousal loopholes. They’re tough discussions & politically unpopular.  It’s one under-discussed side to cracking the nut of money in politics.  Multi-millionaires can also weaponize these convos to their advantage, for cuts."
"For ex, members of Congress have strict restrictions that most of the public don’t have.  1 case: bc of our jobs we *have* to have 2 residences & pay for it out of pocket. BUT we‘re banned from writing it off as a work expense.  Boo hoo, right? Well, that incentivizes loopholes."
"Keeping it real, the 🐘 in the room w/ passing a lobbying ban on members requires a nearly-impossible discussion about Congressional pay.  It is understandably unpopular to discuss giving Congress any raises or perks - & bc of that, there’s incentive to keep $ loopholes open. /2"
Also LATINX outlets like @REMEZCLA did digital as well
"Other early outlets included: - online progressive outlets (ex. @TYT) - local outlets (ex. @WNYC, @villagevoice) - nonprofit outlets (ex. @theintercept) - WOMEN’S outlets (ex. @Refinery29, & the day or two before, @voguemagazine digital)"

At the event I will also unveil my newest platform policy: Abolish Sour Mix 2020 😉
"A Garibaldi/Garibaldi spritz is an underrated brunch cocktail.  (For those reading: it’s a Campari&OJ. Pull back on the Campari so it’s not too “woof.” For the spritz, add prosecco or sparkling water, depending on how forward you want it.  Mocktail: replace Campari w/ pom juice!)"
"All of this is to say that words matter, and can have consequences for safety.  For those who believe in “free speech”: whose free speech do you believe in?  Bc some folks using free speech to defend racism are also supporting folks passing laws to allow running over protesters."
"I don’t even get to see all of them. Just the ones that have been flagged as particularly troubling.  It happens whenever Fox gets particularly aggressive + hateful, too. Young interns have to constantly hear hateful messages (far beyond disagreement) from ppl we don’t even rep."
"This is not a critique of congestion pricing per se, but it’s to say you can’t just tag any random climate policy + call it GND.  Nowhere in the text do we mention congestion pricing.  If you’re a journalist that’s going to report on/talk about the GND, READ THE RESOLUTION."
"Today, #MemorialDay, we honor the lives of all those who gave their lives, both abroad and at home, in service to our country.  It’s a hard day for many. Take time to be there for one another; to check in, share stories, reflect, or mark quietly with a moment of gratitude."

"Notice the people willing to explain this away, yet when Ilhan’s words are taken out of context, they are the 1st to jump on her.  Look at how these accusations are selectively enforced on the left, esp when it’s the *alt-right* actually committing antisemitic violence in the US."
"It ALL started with everyday people.  You would really be surprised how much work here gets started because a journalist picked up on a story, or advocates organized people to command notice of an issue.  It’s inspiring how much power everyday people have. We just need to use it."
We held the hearing. PrEP is going generic a year early.  It was thanks to: - Everyday people who advocated & didn’t quit until someone listened - A young staffer who listened & dug in - Committee staff that took her seriously - Generous leadership that cultivates the next gen /5
"Chairman/woman leadership varies widely in style.  For ex, Seniority matters a LOT in Congress. But Chairman Cummings is generous w/ junior members. He invests a lot of time in training a high standard of excellence on the Committee of ALL members.  So he gave us a rare shot. /4"
"In working with our staffer, Oversight Committee was able to pull in  request a great deal of docs and evidence in the case.  Bc Dems won the House, Dems control committees + Chairs.  It was the leadership of the Chairman @RepCummings that brought the issue to a hearing. /3"
"After vetting the case these organizers presented, she saw that it seemed they were. She passed it by me and our office engaged the Oversight Committee.  Committee staffers are CRITICAL. They have the expertise, tenure, relationships, etc to investigate issues + inquiries. /2"
Let’s talk abt how Gov works behind the scenes: Remember that Big Pharma hearing last week?  Here’s how it happened.  A 23 y/o staffer in my office met w/ local HIV advocates. They argued the CDC held the patent for PrEP & Gilead was price gouging.  She picked it up + dug in. /1
This hits too close to home 🙃
"When I ran last year, everyone and their cousin endorsed my opponent.  After he lost,did people imply that the Gov’s endorsement wasn’t powerful anymore? That virtually every single union in NYC no longer had influence?  No! It was about the candidates and the race. It always is."
"I endorsed @CabanForQueens for DA not out of a “power move,” but because to me it feels like the right thing to do.  Electing a public defender to a DA’s position with her platform could be transformative, &the organizers busting their butts on the ground have earned recognition."
Thank you!
.@AyannaPressley is breathing 🔥 in FSC right now and it is glorious to watch.  Good job sis.
"Remember, Clinton was also impeached - that failed in Sen too. Our institutions didn’t suffer then, but they have been damaged greatly today w unwillingness to impeach.  Whether it’s Dem fear or GOP recklessness, doesn’t matter. Failure to impeach now is neglect of due process."
"Shout out to @RepJayapal for leading on Medicare for All. Her leadership on #M4A in the House has made it stronger than ever, and she also secured its first-ever hearing in the bill’s history. 💪🏽💜"

"White Supremacists get charged w hate crimes. Muslims get charged w terrorism.  This is a HUGE difference. Hate crimes are underreported, deprioritized, + aren’t treated as seriously as domestic terror charges.  Yet in the US, Neo-Nazi violence far outnumbers Islamic extremism."
What angers me about the GOP’s attempts to turn the United States into a far-right Christian theocracy is how dishonest they are about it.  At least be forthright about your desire to subvert and dismantle our democracy into a creepy theological order led by a mad king.
"The GOP doesn’t care about babies at all - especially brown, black, or poor ones. If they did, they’d: - cosponsor the Green New Deal or at LEAST have a real climate plan - guarantee healthcare so ALL can get prenatal care - not stand for the death+caging of babies on our border"
"To the GOP extremists trying to invoke “the unborn” to jail people for abortion:  Where are you on climate change? OH right, you want to burn fossil fuels til there’s hell on Earth.  If they were truthful about their motives, they’d be consistent in their principles. They’re not."
"Yep! I’m just carrying it in the House and whipping votes there 😉 but if Mitch McConnell wants to actually use religious principles for good + reinstate usury laws, he’s more than welcome."
"Ultimately, this is about women’s power.   When women are in control of their sexuality, it threatens a core element underpinning right-wing ideology: patriarchy.  It’s a brutal form of oppression to seize control of the 1 essential thing a person should command: their own body."
"Abortion bans aren’t just about controlling women’s bodies.  They’re about controlling women’s sexuality. Owning women.  From limiting birth control to banning comprehensive sex ed, US religious fundamentalists are working hard to outlaw sex that falls outside their theology."
Thank you Rep. Raskin - it’s all because I get to learn from the best! Thanks for your leadership in calling + prioritizing this hearing.
"Not technically the 1st time, a few weeks ago I briefly covered for @RepRaskin for a few minutes as he quickly ran to a vote in Judiciary. But this is definitely my first time chairing for a significant amount of time!"
"Actually it *would* be a felony for women - if those women are medical providers. See? According to your own semantic standard, you “lied.”  We can fact-check obvious semantics all day and make absurd bad faith claims if that’s how you want be. But I have better uses for my time."
"It’s a felony punishable by jail, incl cases of women pregnant by rape or incest. Twitter is 280 chars - read the context clues in grammar of the tweet.  But good to know you’re here to promote criminalizing medical providers aiding victims of rape and incest! 👍🏽 good job"
This law would force children - 12 year olds - to carry a pregnancy by their rapist.  This law would force people w/ mental disabilities to carry pregnancy by rape to term.  This law forces people to be pregnant against their own consent. It’s horrifying.
"But also if you’re a staffer getting invited to a spa weekend funded by lobbyists, maybe ask yourself why you’re saying yes to that.  It’s like those timeshare co’s who offer free vacations to people. You THINK you’re gonna say no, but they do it for a reason."
"So sometimes you think you’re getting some straightforward info by some professor here or there, as if it’s a CRS report or something.  But instead they just saying “objectively” that social security isn’t worth saving, etc. Without other viewpoints."
It’s not that simple. Oftentimes you have no idea you’re listening to a lobbyist bc they incorporate 3rd party groups with confusing names.  I saw this 1st hand at the Harvard “Orientation” hosted by AEI. It was marketed at “objective” (lobbyists always say they’re objective).
"It’s that bundle 💰 for elections, so you pick up their call,accept invites, become friends.  In practice it’s not transactional, it’s social.  So while ppl don’t see how lobbying influences votes, their whole enviro + staff has been exposed to mainly 1 point of view: lobbyists’."
"When I was looking at lobbying from the outside, just as a normal voting citizen, it appeared to me as more transactional in nature than it actually is.  It’s not necessarily that a lobbyist calls you and says “vote/don’t vote for this bill or we won’t donate to you again...” /2"
"And in the meantime, as we continue fighting for Medicare for All, a living wage, & more:  Unionize your workplace. Demand a raise. And don’t stop until you get one. 💪🏽"
"Ultimately, living in a moral society, a good nation, means establishing some basic standards of dignity: - healthcare as a right - a living wage - public education that prepares for civil society + economy (which now shld incl college) - all people having power in the economy"
"When we say “tax the rich,” we mean nesting-doll yacht rich. For-profit prison rich. Betsy DeVos, student-loan-shark rich.  Trick-the-country-into-war rich. Subsidizing-workforce-w-food-stamps rich.  Because THAT kind of rich is simply not good for society, & it’s like 10 people."
"US GDP is at an all-time high. As a nation, we are more prosperous than we ever have been.  But that’s simply not the lived truth. Even now, I’m paid similar to a doctor or corporate lawyer - many who‘d think they are “rich,” but it’s nowhere near what we actually mean in policy."
"The myth that bad credit or struggling w bills = irresponsibility is a heinous myth.  Paying people less than what’s needed to live is what’s actually irresponsible.  GDP + costs are rising, wages are not. That doesn’t mean YOU’RE bad. It means working people are set up to fail."
"Now I’m going through a huge income transition compared to living off tips (which diff pay every week, very hard).  & I have HEALTH INSURANCE, which now means I have fewer expenses.  According to banks, I’d be more “responsible,” but my character hasn’t changed. Just my math. /3"
"When I was waitressing, I used to jerk awake in the middle of sleep worried that I may have forgotten if a bill cleared, or if I had enough 💰 to pay a Dr in cash.  Was that bc I was “irresponsible?” No. It’s bc I wasn’t being paid a living wage as cost of living skyrocketed. /2"
Going from waitressing a year ago to now carries a LOT of life-adjustments.  But 3 paychecks in has shown me how 1 of the greatest scams in US is the idea that financial struggle is due to “poor character.”  It’s a huge myth designed to keep people from empowering themselves. /1
If you don’t understand this man’s sign - or don’t approach it with a desire to - then you do not understand this political moment.  The same folks who said Trump was impossible in 2016 are the same ones lecturing on what’s “electable” in 2020.   Don’t buy it. Vote your values.
"The forces getting in the way of solving our climate crisis are politicians themselves + lobbyists. It is the willingness to bend to corporate power - the same ones that use coal miners’ plights for a tax break, yet refuse to pay for those same miners’ healthcare for black lung."
"All of this is to say don’t let any politician, no matter the party, lecture you about what is “possible” or “electable.”  Don’t ever let a politician imply that working people are “less-than” or “uneducated” - aka that they are the ones in the way of solving the climate crisis."
"Then he said, “I like you. I can tell that you are genuine and fighting for us. You’re real and you get it.”  I thanked him and his family from the bottom of my heart."
"I somehow got it out: “With all respect sir, how do you... manage to support both of us at the same time?”  This is what he said: “I’ve been saying for years that climate change is our most important crisis. You’re one of the only ones who‘s been willing to be decisive on it.”"
"I was pretty astonished.  We shook hands, he introduced himself, and told me he wanted to show his support.  I could barely get my question out - I wanted to honor his positivity, yet respectfully find a way to ask, “How?”"
"Lastly, if anyone has recommendations for baby gear that folds up nicely or tips on how to prep a workplace for little ones, please give me your recs!  If you’re a new mom/parent + could bring your babies / kids to work, what would help that? What would you want to see? ⬇️"
"8. This is convo is bigger than parental leave - it’s a larger conversation about how modern work has grown so hostile to family life. It doesn’t have to be that way!  Work + family can go together, but we have to break down the barriers that force people to choose between them."
"7. Additionally, paying a living min wage to our most junior staffers means they’re talented + capable (no 2nd job) to take over big-time situations, meaning senior staffers are confident enough in them to take parental leave and not feel like everything will fall apart."
6. We make an effort to make our office family-friendly. We talk about what play mats + cribs we need along w/ our legislative agenda. My personal office can be used for pumping/feeding.  Staff can bring their babies to work if they like & we are working to prepare to have them.
"5. Equal pay at work is about SO much more than the salary you offer.  If you give dads less paid parental leave than moms, you’re contributing to the pay gap.  If you see pregnancy or family as a workplace obstacle, you’re contributing to the pay gap."
4. I want to reiterate how important it is to give dads full parental leave. I strongly encourage them to take the full time.  I’ve heard the “normal” paternity leave is 2 weeks. That is NOT okay! As my partner says: “What do employers expect those new moms to do? Walk it off?”
"3. Our 12 weeks parental leave is up to the parent on how they want to use that time. They don’t have to take all 12 weeks at once - for example, they can take 5 weeks off and work 2 days a week to transition in; bank 3 weeks for later in the year, etc.   /4"
"2. Paid parental leave applies to ALL new parents, period. Moms, dads, parents; biological or adopted. If you’ve got a new child, you get  12 weeks to spend adjusting your family to this huge transition.  /3"
"A few notes on our approach:  1. Expecting a child has nothing to do with our hiring decisions, & we do everything we can to accommodate. That’s supposed to be law, but there are small ways (incl self-selection) where it can play a role. We work to be a pro-family workplace.  /2"
"I’d like to share another “unusual” (but shouldn’t be) part of my office policy w/ you all: Parental Leave!  Three members of our small team are expectant or new parents in the first 6 mos of my term.  In my office, *every* new parent receives 3 mos paid leave - including dads."
"Really, the biggest, boldest idea (other than war) the GOP has proposed is A Wall.  At this rate they’re gonna propose getting us to space w/ trebuchets.  They constantly hate, but have 0 real solutions for income inequality, healthcare, climate crisis, racial injustice, etc."
"GOP is talking smack about the Post Office (of course, since they have no ideas).  The funny thing about that: it‘s the GOP’s own “business model” that hurt them! They forced USPS to prefund pensions decades out (which makes NO sense & no solvent biz does)instead of year to year."
"New policy proposal dropping tomorrow with a special Senate co-lead 😎  It’s radical, which I always love, and we’re keeping more coins in your pocket, which I also love."
"Before we won, climate issues were ranked very low in nat’l voter priorities.  Thanks to risk-taking activism, it’s now consistently ranked as a #1 or at least a top 3 issue for many voters.  Leadership is often about choice: take the temperature, or change the thermostat."
"For context, this kicks in within days of a typical at-home test working.  If you were sexually assaulted (stress delays cycle), took a morning-after pill (throws off cycle), or have an irregular cycle, you‘d have no idea.  There are a TON of ways this law ignores basic biology."
PSA for folks who haven’t had consistent healthcare/doctors:  Get your Tetanus vaccine booster!  You’re supposed to get them every 10 yrs as an adult - I just got mine bc I didn’t have insurance for a bit.  My shot also included a whooping cough booster bc of recent outbreaks.
And by bit I mean like 10 words 🤣 trying out here
"I honestly thought GOP witnesses would be well-prepared, w/ sophisticated arguments for the opposing view - evil-genius lobbyist types.  But they’re often sloppy + reaching (not all though). I think if everyday GOP voters saw the witnesses called on their behalf, they’d be upset."
"You are using this as an excuse to stoke suspicion around my Christianity + faith life, @KellyannePolls.  The Sri Lanka massacre was horrifying. No one should be targeted for their religion.  If you’re so moved, let’s do more to welcome immigrants fleeing religious persecution."
"The terrorist attack in Sri Lanka was horrifying. Saying ‘Easter worshippers’ matters bc Easter is the holiest day of the year for Christians, & to be targeted on Easter highlights how heinous the attack was - just as saying yesterday’s #SanDiego shooting was on Passover."
"“Corrupt” is a good one, too.  I’m curious, how do you spin ignoring and neglecting the largest mass death of people on American soil in decades, @KellyannePolls?  After all, the official count of 3,075 people is much bigger than the 64 number your admin clung to for so long."
"I chose to use the word ‘incompetent’ when it comes to Trump’s response to Hurricane María & the 3,000 Americans who died on his watch, but that’s only because I had 280 characters.  There are plenty of other words too: - Negligent - Inept - Inhumane - Predatory  Take your pick."
GOP already bad-faith attacking “nonviolent offenses.” Clearly if you are looking at CONTEXT CLUES in my thread & limits of 280 chars you know I’m referring to nonviolent drug offenses.  Swear it’s like we’re back to encouraging 1st grade readers when it comes to some “pundits.”
"To understand how racial injustice works subconsciously in America, all you need to do is watch how quickly + readily some people jump to justify stripping voting rights for millions of people, yet how uncomfortable and fraught that convo becomes when one brings up reparations."
"-We “shouldn’t” incarcerate for nonviolent offenses, -We “shouldn’t” have school-to-prison pipelines, -We “shouldn’t” sentence poc more than white people for similar crimes,  ...but we do.  We’re so eager to talk about punishment, but correcting our injustices is “controversial.”"
Reminder: - Slavery ➡️ Jim Crow + Redlining ➡️ War on Drugs ➡️ Mass Incarceration  - Black Americans & PoC are far more likely to be convicted + sentenced longer than White Americans for similar crimes.  - Our system routinely criminalizes poverty + exonerates wealth
"To avoid looking completely + utterly out of touch w/ the reality our prison system:  Instead of asking, “Should the Boston Bomber have the right to vote?”  Try, “Should a nonviolent person stopped w/ a dime bag LOSE the right to vote?”  Bc that question reflects WAY more people."
"Like many public systems, GOP want to rip the battery out + say the whole car doesn’t work, so they can sell it for parts.  Fully funding the VA & hiring to fill the *49k vacancies* is a clear path to improving it - not auctioning off our vet care systems to for-profit companies."
"I rep one of the strongest concentrations of veterans in NYC. The Bronx VA provides excellent care and community for our vets, who sing its praises.  The way to improve VA care & reduce wait times (which can be shorter than priv care!) is by fully funding it - not privatizing it."
"Just got back from a few (mostly) unplugged days visiting my abuela in PR, and I see the President is tweeting about me.  Just another day at the office! 😊"
I’m STILL thinking about that lip sync
"Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment. I didn’t campaign on it, & rarely discuss it unprompted.  We all prefer working on our priorities: pushing Medicare for All, tackling student loans, & a Green New Deal.  But the report squarely puts this on our doorstep."
"While I understand the political reality of the Senate + election considerations, upon reading this DoJ report, which explicitly names Congress in determining obstruction, I cannot see a reason for us to abdicate from our constitutionally mandated responsibility to investigate."
"What if a bold agenda rooted in improving everyday people’s lives is part of a winning strategy?  What if the choice btwn big ideas+winning elections is a false one that crept up through outsize influence of💰in politics?  What if, in a nation parched for change, we were water?🌊"
"I’m not going to quote the NY Post’s horrifying, hateful cover.  Here’s 1 fact: @IlhanMN is a cosponsor of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. She‘s done more for 9/11 families than the GOP who won’t even support healthcare for 1st responders- yet are happy to weaponize her faith."
"I see we’re going pun-for-pun, Rabbi 😂"
"Only things we *can’t* plant are sunflowers🌻, corn🌽 , mint🌱, & strawberries🍓.  Aside from that, the world is our community garden 🌞"
Happy Sunday! Excited to say I’m tending to a community garden plot for the next few months :)  It’s a 4x4 plot we get to tend to now through Sept.  Any green-thumbs out with sage🌱 words of advice?  What should I plant? (Ideally at least 1 edible thing but we can do flowers too)
"The good news is that we can improve this easily w/ honest reflection.  For ex, are certain hairstyles discouraged in your workplace?Why?  Can you think of someone who didn’t advance bc of how they spoke? Why?  Examine what’s deemed “unprofessional” around you & adapt it to 2019."
"We see the perceived “costs” to not code-switching all the time.  Can’t tell you how many young people in our community don’t have the confidence they should bc they didn’t grow up learning secondary speech.  Their talents get stifled by “respectability,” despite enormous gifts."
"As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home.  It is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time."

"GOP taking every tweet so earnestly, making my point for me. It’s not an argument against the price of a croissant - it’s about the value of human worth.  But I guess that idea is foreign to them since their policies treat people as disposable anyway 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"Croissants at LaGuardia are going for SEVEN DOLLARS A PIECE 😱  Yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??"
"The @DCCC’s new rule to blacklist+boycott anyone who does business w/ primary challengers is extremely divisive & harmful to the party.  My recommendation, if you’re a small-dollar donor: pause your donations to DCCC & give directly to swing candidates instead.  Some great ones:"
"Solidarity > “civility,” bc you can very civil while arguing for the inhumane + unacceptable. You can be “civil” while locking up kids & drugging them in detention camps, or stripping people of their insulin or civil rights.  Civility is abt appearance. Solidarity is abt action."
Follow tonight’s convo using the hashtag #AOCAllin - the best part of tonight is the panelists and experts we’ve gathered to discuss our possibilities.  (Even a Republican came! 🤯)
"Word. But someone’s got to care about growing the Dem base: the thing ppl don’t realize is that the House is where you can build turnout infrastructure to win Presidentials. When we don’t invest in blue-seat organizing in the House, we don’t get the turnout we need every 4 years."
"Thank you for recommending it! Several others had been DMing me on IG about it, but I had lost the name of the app in the sea of messages. When you told me in person I was able to recall& download it.  You + those advocates are the main reason why I started captioning when I did!"
"(& no to the trolls, not suggesting that this ex. be met with leg - though the quoted tweet certainly could be. What ex. shows is we ALL should ask questions about accessibility in our everyday lives, of ourselves + others. That’s how we figure out solutions, leg or otherwise.)"

"In order for us to heal as a nation, we ALL must pursue the hard work of addressing these root causes.  It’s not as easy as voting. It means having uncomfortable moments convos w/ loved ones, w/ media, w/ those we disagree, and yes - within our own party, too.  It’s on all of us."
"He can stay, he can go. He can be impeached, or voted out in 2020.  But removing Trump will not remove the infrastructure of an entire party that embraced him; the dark money that funded him; the online radicalization that drummed his army; nor the racism he amplified+reanimated."
Gotta love how the same folks who tolerate+ acquiesce to building a medieval wall along the entire US southern border as a (non-evidence based) solution for a “crisis” that doesn’t exist are now suddenly concerned that pursuing a nat’l response to climate change is “unrealistic.”
"Folks often try to make this convo abt members from mod, swing districts.  We get that those members do what they need to rep.  But many members of Congress got there via safe primaries. It’s how many working people, women, + poc folks overcome institutional bias to get elected."
"The 🐘 in the room here is big money & lobbyist donors.  Our current system incentivizes *all,* no matter the party, to place big donors before voters.  No primaries means lobbyist💰will have even *more* influence over policy, bc voters will have one less avenue to pursue change."
"The majority of Americans live in safe districts, where gen election isn’t competitive.  By stymieing primaries, you deny most voters their best chance at choosing their representative. We also deny the party the opportunity of training up a future bench, something we badly need."

"This is progress, and there is still work to do.  There should not be a for-profit industry behind the detention and incarceration of human beings.  The US locks up more people than anywhere else in the world, incl China. For-profit caging shouldn’t be legal in the first place."

"Everyone’s last names are hyphenated - so you children take the first names of each of their parents.  ex: my dad was Ocasio-ABC, my mom’s was Cortez-XYZ  So I am Ocasio-Cortez  (When they married, my mom became Ocasio-Cortez too - wives keep father’s name + take husband’s too)"
"For the curious, in Latinx culture children take *both* their parents‘ names.  It’s not a “progressive, new thing.” It’s just how some names work. PR hyphenates, others mark differently. Your last name = the families that came together to make you.  AOC is also fine though :)"
"My last name is Ocasio-Cortez. Full stop. That’s my name.  No, you can’t say “Cortez.” I’ve never used that in my life. “Cortez” is referring to someone else.  Even if they‘re trying to be rude + wrong, my dad’s last name was Ocasio anyway.  (His name was hyphenated too, though.)"
"By the way: Fox News likes to say my name (incorrectly) as “Cortez,” which I can only imagine is bc that sounds more ‘stereotypically’ Hispanic + probably incites more ‘anxiety’ for them.  Pro Tip: My last name is not “Cortez,” just as theirs isn’t “Ingra” or “Carl” or “Hann.”"
"My deepest condolences, Soledad. Thank you for sharing her important story with us."
"This is different than being moderate on policy. I may disagree w/ approach (keeping the ACA as-is w/small tweaks, etc), but at least that’s a policy convo.  But to make decisions based on the political efficacy of a bigoted argument gives that bigotry power, & that’s a problem."
"We can’t gloss over it, or quietly consider that the “shrewd” thing to do is nominate someone who won’t be subject to bigoted attacks.  Morally, we can’t give a pass to this dangerous tactic.  But even politically, the Dem base is all the people you demoralize by not standing up."
"The reason people know more is bc Fox News has turned into “AOC TMZ” (no offense to TMZ), so awareness is growing w/ GOPers.  @JaneMayerNYer has reported deeply on this propaganda machine + it will be aimed at any Dem they want. Nothing changes that.  We can’t be scared by that."
"According to this polling/headline, “everyone hates AOC except most of the country” 🤣"
"Fwiw this clip is cut out of context + the first 1/2 of the interviewer’s question is cut off. If I recall correctly,she was asking about the challenges some may pose to complicate the convo. This isn’t my take, just offering that they are possible challenges to prep for in convo"
"At first, learning about white supremacy can be confusing or challenging.  There’s a lot there, + it can be emotionally hard to realize one may have done or participated in something racist in the past (& still may slip up!).  That’s okay. The whole point is learning + improving."
"If we truly want to address the problem of white supremacist violence, we have to learn how to recognize it + how it shows up in our culture.  Surprisingly to some, signs of white supremacist culture are NOT easy to spot early for those aren’t aware.  Because it’s everywhere."
"Friends,  Morning (Friday) is Jummah, the weekly day of worship for our community of Muslim friends and loved ones.  Be there for them. Check in. Perhaps extend a kind gesture at your local mosque.  There is so much fear and hate.  We must negate it with active, courageous love."
"(“Thoughts and prayers” is reference to the NRA’s phrase used to deflect conversation away from policy change during tragedies. Not directed to PM Ardern, who I greatly admire.)"
"This is a time of great vulnerability for our communities.  We must come together, fight for each other, & stand up for neighbors.  Isolation, dehumanizing stereotypes, hysterical conspiracy theories, & hatred ultimately lead to the anarchy of violence.  We cannot stand for it."
Here’s the key question: where do bath robes play in all of this?  (Also imo quality towels > 50 towels)
This is for a bed and breakfast 😂

"Is Instagram still down? Bc after 2 months almost furnitureless in DC I am trying to take you all on the riveting adventure of getting: a chair 😆  (Also, if you had to start a new apt from scratch, what would be the first 5 pieces of furniture/items you would get? Asking for me)"
"Same w/ member pay.  Members are paid more than avg - but job reqs 2 residences + we can’t take tax deductions for work costs.  No one wants to be the one to bring up increases, so instead ppl take advantage of insider trading loopholes & don’t close them for the extra cash. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"The key here is in the advance knowledge. When you *knowingly* do something that you know *in advance* will do harm, and do it anyway, you open yourself up.  Companies *know in advance* that climate change will get worse if we keep growing fossil fuel consumption and production."
The difference here is that we *already know* abt climate change.   We know that more fossil fuels will harm us. Banks know. Fossil fuel cos know. Gov + politicians know.  It’s not an accident. It’s cause+effect. We knew DAPL would leak. And we know the next gen is in danger.
"Sea walls will have to go up as seas rise. Wildfires to put out. Roads repaved. Nascent technology to explore. Electrical grids replaced.  It’s too late for us to not have to deal w/ the impact of climate change. At this point we shouldn’t be debating IF we do it, it’s how."

"- HIV/AIDS crisis and demonization of LGBT+ community - Union-busting - Ending the Fairness Doctrine, which launched the polarized media environment we’re suffering from today  Why are we not supposed to talk about these things?"
"This is why we advocate for: - Medicare for All - Tuition-free public college - Investing in dignified jobs that build our nation + get us to 100% renewables before it’s too late.  These are investments in people, not profits. Corps aren’t incentivized to ensure people’s health."

"I find it revealing when people mock where I came from, & say they’re going to “send me back to waitressing,” as if that is bad or shameful.  It’s as though they think being a member of Congress makes you intrinsically “better” than a waitress.  But our job is to serve, not rule."
"Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today?  Oh, there’s none?  Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not?  No? Okay. Got it."
"(To also be fair, sometimes committee hearings overlap and you have to choose which one you’re going to. Happened to me earlier today - had to leave this hearing earlier so I could ask questions on Oversight about the opioid crisis)"
"Remember when all the left did was finger-wag & make cynical assumptions, instead of showing up despite an imperfect moment?  When the main defense is rooted in telling others how to feel - especially when you’re not from that community - it’s not solid ground. I ask other Qs."
"Literally nowhere did I say that. If you’re not going to read and listen to what I’ve been saying all day, then misinterpret + jump to a wrong conclusion about it, then I don’t know what to tell you.  You’re not going to falsely pit me against her, or anyone else for that matter."
"The way we reject the 0-sum idea that some communities win at the cost of others is by using opportunities to address issues intersectionally - to highlight that Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all bigotry serve the same ends & that we prevent division by championing one another."
I respectfully disagree. The disproportionate treatment is what is exacerbating the situation.  I think this moment is a good opportunity for an intersectional approach.
"None of this is “whataboutism.” Racism and bigotry of all forms is inextricably linked.  When you don’t address them as a system and attempt to pick them apart as though they are distinct and separable issues, eventually the thing that gets advanced is white supremacy + classism."
The entire PREMISE of a wall is not based in fact.  It’s based in a racist + non-evidence based trope that immigrants are dangerous.  Yet some Dems are willing to “compromise” & spend BILLIONS on a trope because we’ve accepted some kinds of racism as realpolitik in America.
Thanks for clarifying the source tweet.   Treatment is still completely different.
"It means not invading an entire nation without end. Doesn’t mean “do nothing,” it means perhaps we could have leaned more on the larger role of other agencies (intelligence, state dept, diplomatic teams, etc) before Congress decided to invade a nation without a concrete end plan."
"I think that our decision to enter unlimited engagement in Afghanistan, particularly through the AUMF + Congress’ abdication of power + decision-making w/ passage of the AUMF, was a mistake.  Other options: targeting the network itself, limited engagement, non-intervention."
"If House leadership is creating a standard & committing to calling a resolution for every incident - whether it’s the Congressional Black Caucus, CHC, etc, then thats a clear way to address the issue & we can all understand.  But if they’re not, I think it’s valid to ask why not."
"It’s not zero-sum + we have a serious responsibility to listen to communities when they feel pain.  Where I struggle is how we deal with that pain: the “how” after the “what.”  I also fear brooding resentment,bc PoC are *always* promised that ppl will “work harder”w/o commitment."
"And don’t even get me started on misogyny.   If we called resolutions on sexist statements, a good chunk of Congress would be gone.  To jump to the nuclear option every time leaves no room for corrective action.  So I ask *everyone* that we practice calling in before calling out."
"I often think about how I work with white or male allies when they say something insensitive.  The 1st thing I do is pull them aside + say “hey, you may not be aware of X thing regarding Latinx people, but here is the history and it’s hurtful. If you want to learn more, read Y.”"
"“Calling out” is one of the measures of last resort, not 1st or 2nd resort.  We do it when repeated attempts to “call in” are disrespected or ignored. And I believe that Ilhan, in her statement a few weeks ago, has demonstrated a willingness to listen+work w/impacted communities."
"In this administration + all others, we should actively check antisemitism, anti-blackness, homophobia, racism, and all other forms of bigotry.  And the most productive end goal when we see it is to educate and heal.  It’s the difference btwn “calling in” before “calling out.”"
"It’s not my position to tell people how to feel, or that their hurt is invalid.  But incidents like these do beg the question: where are the resolutions against homophobic statements? For anti-blackness? For xenophobia? For a member saying he’ll “send Obama home to Kenya?”"
"(But honestly we shouldn’t have been in either, and we should end the AUMF now while we’re at it)"
Afghanistan War* my apologies
"Or now, even with a disastrous choice like Elliot Abrams at the helm (a man guilty of crimes related to Iran-contra, including misleading Congress) - it still seems like critiquing US interventionism is taboo.  History shows that making some questions “unacceptable” is a mistake."
"I remember a time when it was “unacceptable” to question the Iraq War.   All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP & Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret, except for the one member who stood up: Barbara Lee."
"Sending you, Rachel, and Baby Carl all the love, strength, and support in the world."
Thanks for taking the time. I’m thankful we could share a compassionate and productive conversation that hopefully lays the groundwork for future dialogue.
Thank you Sen. @LuisSepulvedaNY!
- Does the program make selected individuals feel lucky just to be there? - What’s the curriculum? - Big one: Is the org actively learning + adapting their processes based on experiences w/ program members? -What is the org trying to learn and what internal weak spots does it ID?
"In my opinion, it’s all in the execution:  - Why is the program being implemented (bc current lack of diversity looks bad, or bc you’re actively trying to cultivate talent?) - Does the program put people in positions of consequential decision-making power or are they just around?"
"Yes, I dispute it. It’s tricky to nail down exactly what happened when reporting on closed-door meetings.  I did say Dems voting to expand ICE powers were creating a list, but not for primaries. It’s the MTR vote list that GOP and immigration advocates alike can use to lobby."
"We can have ideological differences and that’s fine. But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right, and said as much in a closed door meeting."
"Mind you, the same small splinter group of Dems that tried to deny Pelosi the speakership, fund the wall during the shutdown when the public didn’t want it, & are now voting in surprise ICE amendments to gun safety legislation are being called the “moderate wing” of the party."
"If you’re mad that I think people SHOULD KNOW when Dems vote to expand ICE powers, then be mad.  ICE is a dangerous agency with 0 accountability, widespread reporting of rape, abuse of power, + children dying in DHS custody.  Having a D next to your name doesn’t make that right."
"#MomsDemand & #MarchForOurLives activists, who flew in from across the country, were watching from the gallery, crying + confused.  I ran up to them *during the vote* and explained that the gotcha amendment pinned gun safety against immigration advocacy. Its intent was to divide."
"What I DID say was that I had to go back to my district & share the MTR vote to explain why a pro-ICE amendment was slipped into a gun safety law.  Maybe they’re mad bc I don’t believe pro-ICE expansion votes should be cast in the dark, and people deserve to know what happened."
.@RepJoshHarder is awesome to work with 👍🏽
"No problem! Thanks for taking my replies into consideration. There’s a ton of press inquiry volume so we can’t always get to everything, but we try as much as we can!"

"Spending a few hours today doing calltime.  But instead of calling donors, I’m calling constituents to personally follow up on casework they’ve brought to our office, and give them progress updates myself.  Getting big money out of politics means your Reps can do more of this."

"”...but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly...” /3"
"“...could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming...” /2"
"It’s not all about elections, though much of it can be. It’s also about slowly creeping member positions to be more conservative, tradeoff communities of color, or weaken important legislation - no matter your party."
"There are plenty of means of targeting beyond campaigns. One is procedural targeting on the floor, AKA more tough MTRs like the one we were discussing in mtg. Or targeting by way of advocacy, AKA getting a ton of constituent lobby days, crushing your office with phone calls, etc."
"Why would a DC insider, given anonymity for a quote of their liking about a specific member in closed-door meeting, stretch the truth? Gee, I don’t know.  It’s almost as though DC is a place where people are motivated by many different things."
"I didn’t say that they were putting themselves on a list for primaries.  I said that by Dems distinguishing themselves by breaking off on procedural MTR votes, they were inadvertently making a list of targets for the GOP and for progressive advocates on their pro-ICE vote."
"How is anything I said a lie? Rep. Khanna did in fact ask Cohen the question, and Cohen implicated the President and his son in criminal conspiracy.  If you take issue with Cohen’s testimony, perhaps that’s a good reason for us to call in further witnesses."
Republicans are calling HR1 a power grab.  @AyannaPressley had the best rebuttal: “Yup. You got us. We’re grabbing the power back for the people” instead of corporations.
On the job*** Agh
By reposting his creepshot. Got it.  Being creepy to own the creepers 👍🏽
"👍🏽 ok so amplifying the creepshots is okay, got it  Just like the journo tweeting the photo of my backside was okay because that one was sent to him too, right?"
"a) it would help if it was funny b) a former Coast Guard member literally got arrested plotting to kill me last week and Republican journalists have been paying stakeout photographers to take pictures of me going inside my house, maybe read a room c) the tweet is still creepy!"
Also: in before “It WaS a JoKe”
"I still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight. A man was just arrested last week with a stockpile of guns specifically trying to kill me & others, so yeah I’m not gonna disclose my personal address or tell people when I move. Sorry!"
"It’s pretty sad that people think low Congressional staff pay is a good thing.  Low pay a big reason why money in politics is a problem - you can make a lot more money becoming a lobbyist & setting up a relationship w/ one, since the actual job doesn’t pay enough.  Domino effect."
"A lot of people commenting don’t know how Congressional salaries work.  Each member is given a set amount that they disburse. GOP has refused to increase budgets in years to give hard-working staff a raise, which means people helping to run the country are getting paid $30k/year."
The reporter is quote tweeted below. “Astroturfing” is the term for those kinds of bots and online activity.
"If we cared half as much about the wealth we could generate by investing in human capital as much as we cared about real estate speculation, we’d have tuition-free college by now."
You look fab! 😎💕
"Folks handling the failed deal treated community w/condescension+disdain for  their legitimate concerns.  I warned early to any & all that surging NYC costs+failing subways are creating major political forces to be reckoned with.  But I don’t know what I’m talking about, right?🤷🏽‍♀️"
"There was little in the fuzzy proposal that guaranteed jobs for actual NYers, yet lots of hard concessions from the public.  Queens saw how the FoxConn/Wisconsin disaster is working out - a $4.5 billion nightmare - & asked Qs.  The response? “This is above you, you won’t get it.”"
"There’s NO WAY that this deal - one of the biggest giveaways in state history - could possibly have been bad, right?  Surely there can’t be anything wrong with suddenly announcing a massive restructuring & pricing out of a community without any advance notice or input from them."
"Frankly, the knee-jerk reaction assuming that I “don’t understand” how tax giveaways to corps work is disappointing.   No, it’s not possible that I could come to a different conclusion. The debate *must* be over my intelligence & understanding, instead of the merits of the deal."
"Come for me all you want, but my job is to make sure that people are protected in society.   Someone’s got to look out for the people our system is leaving behind - esp now, when most of the wealth created is going to fewer people, those left behind are the majority of Americans."

I think so. Grassroots community members led + organized the whole effort. Wouldn’t have happened if they weren’t there.
"Apparently this is a normal practice, and people don’t bat an eye.  The first few people in line are guaranteed a seat in a given hearing.  This was the hearing for marijuana banking laws. Lobbyists and those who can afford it pay people to hold their spot so they get in 1st."
"Do you really think these increasingly regular & horrific wildfires & droughts are a coincidence?  That growing regularity of “100-year floods” is an accident?  We are losing our homes & loved ones *now.* 3,000 Americans died in María.  And GOP doesn’t even care enough to try."
Disagree. Progressive Jews in my community have been engaging me in private in an effort to not create infighting. Progressive Muslims in my community are concerned w/ being falsely tagged as anti-Semitic. If we can’t reconcile those things via process then nothing will get done.
"“MLK used to teach, “cowardice asks the question, is it expedient? And then expedience comes along and asks the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular?  Conscience asks the question, is it right?“"
"There’s no reason to be afraid of lawmakers if everyday people are being respected, protected, and taken care of.  Now, if financial companies are engaging in predatory practices and ripping off working/middle class families & the poor, then yes, there will be an issue."

"Finally, the reason we scope out with a resolution is bc I am not here to say that only one member of Congress will solve a global crisis.  Think of the GND Res as a “Request for Proposals.”  We’ve defined the scope and where we want to go. Now let’s assess + collab on projects."
"And part of what the #GreenNewDeal says, at last, is that Flint wasn’t an accident. The folks dying in West Virginia aren’t an accident. The Bronx having one of the highest child asthma rates isn’t an accident.  It’s a structural failure to care, & treat these communities fairly."
"The pipes in Flint weren’t a market failure, they were a social failure.  It was a failure to see the people in Flint as important as the WH. Those decisions were predicated on a legacy of racism + dehumanization of the poor.  The enviro issue of water is how that was expressed."
"For far too long, ideas like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade were touted as the premier solutions to climate change.  While those things could be *part* of a solution, the GND resolution says they are inadequate as the whole answer.  The pipes in Flint weren’t a “market failure.”"
"It does not mean the treatment + presumption of guilt before a verdict. It does not mean we aim for the most punitive punishment.  It means that in the eyes of the law, we treat everyone the same.  That’s far from what our current system does. And that’s why it must change."
"As a result, our system is “innocent until proven guilty” only for the rich &“guilty until proven innocent” for the poor.  To borrow from @ZephyrTeachout, the RADICAL rule of law is the idea that in the same scenario, our courts would treat a billionaire the same as a Bronx teen."
"All too often, our criminal justice system - from tickets to convictions - is treated as a game, where the one racks up the most “points” wins.  Paired w/ foolish criminalization of marijuana, poverty,etc, it wrecks chaos on people’s lives + stagnates communities for generations."
"It’s pretty wild that the GOP can’t decide whether they’re going to run with the conspiracy theory that I’m secretly rich, or the exaggeration & mockery of my family’s struggle after my dad died during the financial crisis.  Instead, they decide to defy logic and run with both."
"This stuff is really sad. The GOP is so intellectually bankrupt that they no longer engage to debate issues in good faith, but instead seek to lie, distort, name-call, target, & destroy people/communities w any means possible.  It’s a virus and a race to the bottom."

"Classic example is asking an innocent person “when was the last time you hit your dog?”  They say, “never!” But the frame was invoked. A lot of journalism is subconscious - almost all good public communicators know that, for better or worse.  & That’s the real tea right there 🍵"
"I do think it’s important to note that questions advance certain frames. What 45 *does* understand is that if he can get media to invoke his narrative enough, people will start to believe or operate in it, regardless of truth. Perfect example is the caravan."

"Quote tweet got deleted, but -   I believe workers should enjoy more of the wealth they create, & that democracy belongs in the workplace, too.  GOP believes people should be paid the lowest wages possible, no matter what they produce, so billionaires can scoop up the difference."
"If you want to read more on the issue of monopolies, anti-trust, corruption, and ways to address it, I recommend checking out @ZephyrTeachout.   She literally wrote the book on it."
"The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally & economically unsustainable.  We can’t simply accept the cliché that “journalism is dying.”  Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it - and if journalism dies, our democracy will, too."
"Gonna keep it 💯: The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies & concentration of ownership.  Healthy democracy *requires* high-quality journalism.  W/o a wide range of independent outlets & the revenue to sustain them, our democracy will continue to crumble."

"This reinforces lazy tropes about women leaders in media: - Older + seasoned, but unlikeable - Passionate, but angry - Smart, but crazy - Well-intentioned, but naive - Attractive, but uninformed or gaffe-prone  It’s unoriginal, lazy, and men don’t get the same either/or coverage."
"Lastly, we wouldn’t need to talk about bathrooms at all if we acted like adults, washed our hands + minded our own business instead of trying to clock others.  Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom w/ a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week."
"This stuff infects some Democrats, too. Because in our overall discourse, nonviolent protest somehow gets deemed as not “civil,” yet stripping women’s rights or incarcerating children on the border doesn’t receive the same characterization.   What’s up with that?🕵🏽‍♀️"
"Just look at the marginal tax rate discussion.  The right’s biggest strategy against my marginal tax rate proposal isn’t to argue against it - it‘s to lie about it, and imply that it’s a tax on all income, bc that helps their characterization of me as a “crazy/dumb“ Latina woman."
"If you notice, on the right they’ll flatly call people blanket terms, and even make things up. And I don’t mean trolls - I mean their biggest commentators + TV figures.  This is different from criticizing a specific take you disagree with, or pointing out discriminatory patterns."
"This has deeper consequences, bc as we’ve seen w/ narratives advanced by the right, they have trouble recognizing intelligence in people they disagree with.  This is what bias looks like: for some ppl, small mistakes mean they’re not “serious,” yet others are forgiven for worse."

"There are a handful of opportunities for members to address the House Floor. The most common + accessible one is “Morning Hour,” which happens each day Congress is in session.  Morning hour speeches are limited to 1 minute, so members try to fit in what they can."

"We have district work periods - our jobs aren’t just to vote in DC, but also require us to be rooted in our communities to oversee constituent casework and community outreach.  The work schedule is roughly 4 days DC / 3 days District x3 weeks, then 1 full week in district."
"I could’ve sat there quietly as the far right tore me to shreds (they were guaranteed to do so the moment a woman like me won my primary), or I could fight back+not let them. I chose to define myself instead of allowing them to take that away from me. And that’s why they’re mad."
"I’m uneasy about it too. It’s stressful & scary, but it’s also out of my control, so the best thing I can do is try to focus that attention on the most urgent issues of our time: climate change, good gov, jobs, wages, justice; and highlight the contradictions you explain here."
"It’s a huge win. Obviously there is work to do - there are other money committees (Ways & Means, Energy & Commerce, etc). But we’ve got one down. Before we had 0.  Keep paying attention, chipping into campaigns, and being activists. It works."
"I cannot stress how important this moment is.  Dems are putting members who rejected corporate campaign money on a committee overseeing Wall St.  All because:  1. Everyday people donated to our campaigns, and 2. They started to pay attention + became activists in Congress"
"These legislators, under public pressure, couldn’t deliver as much for big bank lobbyists.  They had to vacate one of the most powerful committees in the House. That made a space that big banks couldn’t fill, and how we got *several* non-Corp funded members into places of power."
"All of a sudden, it became harder for legislators to slip corporate-friendly legislation through committee, because people would write articles and their constituents would find out and grow upset.  As I’ve said before, it’s People vs Money. We’ve got people, they’ve got money."
"Fin Services is one of few exclusive committees.  The jargon around here is that they are the “money committees,” not bc they oversee money,but bc one can fundraise from special interests by sitting on it and giving corporations a listening ear.  Until people started paying attn."
"Activists zoomed in on one place in particular: the Financial Services Committee, which deals with big banks, real estate, and almost every interaction people have in dealing with their own money.  What they found was a place where big bank lobbyists were slipping in their work."
"During + after the 2008 financial crisis, everyday people started to viscerally see the corrosive role of lobbyists writing in legal loopholes that allowed big banks to gamble with people’s lives and the economy as a whole.  Occupy Wall Street emerged, and activism bloomed."
"Personally, I’m looking forward to digging into the student loan crisis, examining for-profit prisons/ICE detention, and exploring the development of public & postal banking. To start. 🙂"
Seriously
Misinformation**
"Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.  King’s district should start working to replace him in 2020. Regardless of party, it’s not good for a district if their Rep has such reprehensible views that they aren’t allowed to touch legislation with a 10 ft pole."
"Thank you for pointing this out. I often in public remarks preceded this by saying “with the exception of Native peoples and African Americans,” but apologize for leaving it out of this tweet. I’ll be more careful moving forward!"
"Journalism isn’t just about the questions you ask, but the questions you don’t.  If you’re a reporter or pundit who has badgered every Dem about “socialism” yet aren’t asking EVERY Republican about what they plan to do about Rep. King’s white supremacy,you’re telling on yourself."
"The difference is that this current GOP admin appeals to the worst within us, stoking an impulse to rationalize erosion.   I believe we must appeal to the best within us+not settle. We should champion the smartest, prosperous, fair, hardest-working + decent version of ourselves."
"I’d say we’d be taxing 70% of Trump’s income, but he probably hasn’t made more than $10 million in years - and that’s the real reason he’s hiding his taxes 😉"
💜 you too!
LaGuardia**** ugh
Anything can happen when you’re stuck in LaGuaradia 😎
"You’d say “that’s cool, but not the same thing as this very crucial electorate, maybe hire someone from the Midwest w/ intimate understanding” and they just throw their hands up and say “now you’re calling me racist?”  It’s like that ??? meme but reading the newspaper every day"
"Like, imagine if the world was flipped & CBS hired an all-poc team to cover 2020, & someone said “hey, white voters are really influential in presidential elections, especially in the Midwest. You should have some white journos who get that” & someone said “I found a Serbian guy”"
"I often find that some members who have to do call time the most are very enthusiastic about getting money out of politics.  Members do want less obligations to lobbyists & more leg. work, but some House races cost < $10 million; & that’s *every 2 years* before outside spending!"
"Y’all, I don’t believe he was being condescending. It was a genuine response 💜"
"Do people realize how insanely dangerous of an idea it is to support *this President* in fabricating a “national emergency” over immigrants, especially when Homeland Security officially assessed the threat level at the southern border “minimal?”  No way. Pressure your Senators."
"At this point those who use the terms “racially tinged” or “racially charged” to describe white supremacy should be prepared to explain why they chose to employ those terms instead of “racist”/“racism.”  If the answer is their own discomfort, they’re protecting the wrong people."
"For those out of the loop, Republicans began to circulate a fake nude photo of me. The @DailyCaller reposted it (!) and refused to indicate it was fake in the title as well.  Completely disgusting behavior from Conservative outlets.  No wonder they defended Kavanaugh so fiercely."
"🤣 ok this was great, flagged you to our team"
"The American people did not organize the biggest midterm election in ~100 years so their new leaders could sit back as the nation waits in crisis.  Our class was elected for a very specific reason: to lead differently, propose bold ideas,and create positive change for all people."
"Let’s refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality.  Right now, 800,000 workers are without a paycheck.  The President is holding gov operations hostage so that he can build a monument to himself on the southern border that the maj of Americans don’t want."
To make*
It *must* be said in a nuanced conversation that questioning where takes come from is nowhere near the same as undermining the extraordinary work reporters and journalists do as “fake news.”  Helping people understand where these takes come from help guard against those attacks.
"I’m not challenging that I was checked - I think the check is a very fair one to masked, and that the coverage illuminated the issue far more than my tweet did.   I *am* confused by the equivalence of the check to other similarly-rated claims that seem much more severe."
"(Also: credit for “facts are facts, America” goes to the illustrious queen Monique Hart)"
Another question for @politifact: some officials’ statements (ex. Andrew Cuomo) get rated “true” frequently.  I say true things all the time - I’d hope most do. When does Politifact choose to rate true statements?  Is there a guide? I’d be happy to repost if there is.
Or why did @washingtonpost give my confusing tweet on military accounting offsets the same “Pinocchios” as Trump’s flat denial of how many Americans died in Puerto Rico?  These are legitimate questions not intended to attack. Who makes these decisions? How? Is there a rubric?
"For example, it looks like @PolitiFact has fact-checked Sarah Huckabee Sanders and myself the *same* amount of times: 6.  She’s been serving for almost 2 years. I’ve served 4 days.  Why is she fact-checked so little? Is she adhering to some standard we don’t know about?"
"This admin clearly had enough extra money to spontaneously build child detention camps all along the southern border + conduct a massive, cross-country family-separation operation.  If anything, DHS’s horrific actions last year means we should consider budget cuts, not increases."
"Mother Ru,  Thank you for your shining example of loving ourselves in our entirety, no matter what the world thinks. You give me hope and strength every day!"
¡Felíz Día de los Tres Reyes! 🐪🤴🏾🎁 Happy Three Kings Day everyone!
💜
I got your back @RashidaTlaib - the Bronx and Detroit ride together 💪🏽💜
"Republican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just “locker room talk,” but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar.  GOP lost entitlement to policing women’s behavior a long time ago.  Next."
Thank you @cher! We can fix Congress and have fun doing it - who says we can’t multitask? 😉💜
Merci beaucoup!
A few social media ideas for public servants looking to build an audience: - Endorse Single-Payer Medicare for All - Hold Wall Street Accountable - Make Min Wage = Living Wage - Cancel Puerto Rican Debt - End For-Profit Prisons & ICE Detention - Fight for a #GreenNewDeal
💪🏽💜
"We must keep pushing on a #GreenNewDeal.  We simply don’t have any other choice. If it’s radical to propose a solution on the scale of the problem, so be it.  We’ve got a planet to save and there’s a whole lot of opportunity we can create in the process."
"While I applaud the establishment of the Select Committee, without subpoena power or the reasonable requests stated, it will be in an even weaker position than the select climate committee of 10 years ago.  There is still time to strengthen it. For all our sake,I hope that we do."
"In DC + even in our own party, it‘s apparently too controversial to ask that we keep oil+gas co’s away from enviro policy.  It’s too controversial to talk about the socioeconomics of Flint, WV, PR & the Bronx.  It’s too controversial to plan for disasters that are already here."
