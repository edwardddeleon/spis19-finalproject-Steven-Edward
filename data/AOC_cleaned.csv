Beyond the moral wrong
The corruption of Trump - of many admins - wouldn’t be politically possible without relying on sympathy for racist policies.  That’s what Reagan’s Black “welfare queen” was all about
For example:  By rallying support for super racist immigration policies
Since corruption isn’t popular policy
If people were actually concerned about undocumented people
About 1/2 of all the cases I see at work are immigration related. Many are people who‘ve been on the path to citizenship for years.  Steps that are supposed to be ~30 days are taking up to a year. Some

5) The Electoral College isn’t about fairness at all; it’s about empowering some voters over others.  Every vote should be = in America
4) We do not give electoral affirmative action to any other group in America. Do Black Americans have their votes count more bc they have been disenfranchised for 100s of years? Do Reservations get an electoral vote? Does Puerto Rico and US territories get them? No. They don’t.
3) LASTLY
2) This common claim about “if we don’t have the Electoral College then a handful of states will determine the presidency” is BS.  a. It’s the *EC itself* that breaks down power by state

But it is incredibly important that we recognize that perfectly normal
What this moment is asking of us is to discuss *white supremacy and racism* as much - or possibly more than - *white supremacists and racists.*  When we do that
Recognizing white supremacy in ourselves - our institutions
Perhaps more than the obvious last steps of the supremacist
Healing ourselves of white supremacy will be hard. It will be hard because it requires us to confront *ourselves.*  We wish it was as simple as denouncing a white hood
White supremacy is often subconscious. & Clearly
There is a difference between white supremacists & white supremacy.  White supremacy is like a virus.   Supremacists are those who have been completely overcome by the disease

The Dem House is a different approach. I’d say the House is arguably & currently structured to be the most conservative of the 3 due to GOP gerrymandering.  Being inspirational & ambitious is good strategy! Being visionary is a strength

But you know what’s the rub of it all
You are angry because you can’t conceive of an America that includes us. You rely on a frightened America for your plunder.  You won’t accept a nation that sees healthcare as a right or education as a #1 priority

Are CBP officers waking up women in the middle of sleep a “funding” problem?  Is calling migrants “filthy” “wh*res” a funding problem?  Is threatening violence on members of Congress a “funding” problem?  No
When you pair: - 9
And to these CBP officers saying they felt “threatened” by me -  They were literally discussing making a GoFundMe for an officer who attacked my on my tour.  They confiscated my phone
What’s haunting is that the women I met with today told me in no uncertain terms that they would experience retribution for telling us what they shared.  They all began sobbing - out of fear of being punished

Dred Scott was the landmark Supreme Court case that found the US Constitution didn’t give citizenship to black people.  The 1st US immigration law was the Chinese Exclusion Act. It was a race-based policy that was upheld until 1942.  The “National Origins Formula” lasted til ‘65.
The history of Citizenship in the US is deeply woven with the history of racism. It has been used as the legal enforcer of racism for most of US history.  Citizenship affords power
Yes! 🇺🇸⚽️✨
Gotta love the rich irony of people who fondly recount stories of how their family’s last names were changed on Ellis Island after their relatives snuck onto a boat escaping some horror now taking fervent anti-immigrant stances & branding innocent human beings as “illegal.”
One narrative in this country that we need to turn on its head is the lie that immigrants are “takers
It’s worked in recent history
We have time. We can stay in town. We can at LEAST add some amendments to this Senate bill. But to pass it completely unamended with no House input? That seems a bridge too far.
0 negotiation with the House. We offered crucial amendments to protect children and families - none are even being considered.  A minority is different than a majority. And while the Senate has to deal with its lack of power there
0 conferencing with House Dems. 0 amendments accepted - including CRUCIAL amendments that would prevent more suffering.  There is enormous frustration here with the capitulation of the Senate minority. But that aside
Under no circumstances should the House vote for a McConnell-only bill w/ no negotiation with Democrats. Hell no.  That’s an abdication of power we should refuse to accept. They will keep hurting kids if we do.
This President will not lift a finger to save these kids.  It is well within his power
In meeting I asked “Why can the president take money from other agencies to build his little wall
His Senate bill is a militarization bill. McConnell killed the House Bill & dropped this one right before recess to force passage.  Well

This President needs to be impeached.
For folks saying we should gloss over this
We are calling these camps what they are because they fit squarely in an academic consensus and definition.  History will be kind to those who stood up to this injustice.  So say what you will. Kids are dying and I’m not here to make people feel comfortable about that.
My heroes are the ones who stood up when it wasn’t easy.  Kids are dying in cages on our border. Families are being put in “freezers” & “dog pounds.”  Years from now
What’s worse
Someone didn’t go to my Twitter class
Not one dime should go to DHS for building these camps as they detain children & families.  Congressional appropriations season is now. That means it’s 💰 time - we‘re voting to fund federal government programs.  We should not fund the caging of kids & families. Pretty simple.
And for the shrieking Republicans who don’t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps.  Concentration camps are considered by experts as “the mass detention of civilians without trial.”  And that’s exactly what this administration is doing.
Concentration camps are not the same as death camps.  This is an important distinction. One of the biggest lessons from that dark history is that it didn’t happen overnight. It emerged out of slow

It’s not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important.  ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That’s why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation
What this does is punish members who rely on a straight salary
I think a lot about the policies I support through the lens of family:  - Ending the war on drugs helps keep families together - A living wage + strong worker protections frees parents to invest more time w/ their kids - Healthcare for all ensures parents + babies are healthier

We held the hearing. PrEP is going generic a year early.  It was thanks to: - Everyday people who advocated & didn’t quit until someone listened - A young staffer who listened & dug in - Committee staff that took her seriously - Generous leadership that cultivates the next gen /5
Chairman/woman leadership varies widely in style.  For ex
In working with our staffer
After vetting the case these organizers presented
Let’s talk abt how Gov works behind the scenes: Remember that Big Pharma hearing last week?  Here’s how it happened.  A 23 y/o staffer in my office met w/ local HIV advocates. They argued the CDC held the patent for PrEP & Gilead was price gouging.  She picked it up + dug in. /1

White Supremacists get charged w hate crimes. Muslims get charged w terrorism.  This is a HUGE difference. Hate crimes are underreported
What angers me about the GOP’s attempts to turn the United States into a far-right Christian theocracy is how dishonest they are about it.  At least be forthright about your desire to subvert and dismantle our democracy into a creepy theological order led by a mad king.
The GOP doesn’t care about babies at all - especially brown
To the GOP extremists trying to invoke “the unborn” to jail people for abortion:  Where are you on climate change? OH right
Yep! I’m just carrying it in the House and whipping votes there 😉 but if Mitch McConnell wants to actually use religious principles for good + reinstate usury laws
Ultimately
Abortion bans aren’t just about controlling women’s bodies.  They’re about controlling women’s sexuality. Owning women.  From limiting birth control to banning comprehensive sex ed
Thank you Rep. Raskin - it’s all because I get to learn from the best! Thanks for your leadership in calling + prioritizing this hearing.
Not technically the 1st time
Actually it *would* be a felony for women - if those women are medical providers. See? According to your own semantic standard
It’s a felony punishable by jail
This law would force children - 12 year olds - to carry a pregnancy by their rapist.  This law would force people w/ mental disabilities to carry pregnancy by rape to term.  This law forces people to be pregnant against their own consent. It’s horrifying.
But also if you’re a staffer getting invited to a spa weekend funded by lobbyists
So sometimes you think you’re getting some straightforward info by some professor here or there
It’s not that simple. Oftentimes you have no idea you’re listening to a lobbyist bc they incorporate 3rd party groups with confusing names.  I saw this 1st hand at the Harvard “Orientation” hosted by AEI. It was marketed at “objective” (lobbyists always say they’re objective).
It’s that bundle 💰 for elections

When we say “tax the rich
US GDP is at an all-time high. As a nation
The myth that bad credit or struggling w bills = irresponsibility is a heinous myth.  Paying people less than what’s needed to live is what’s actually irresponsible.  GDP + costs are rising

Going from waitressing a year ago to now carries a LOT of life-adjustments.  But 3 paychecks in has shown me how 1 of the greatest scams in US is the idea that financial struggle is due to “poor character.”  It’s a huge myth designed to keep people from empowering themselves. /1
If you don’t understand this man’s sign - or don’t approach it with a desire to - then you do not understand this political moment.  The same folks who said Trump was impossible in 2016 are the same ones lecturing on what’s “electable” in 2020.   Don’t buy it. Vote your values.
The forces getting in the way of solving our climate crisis are politicians themselves + lobbyists. It is the willingness to bend to corporate power - the same ones that use coal miners’ plights for a tax break

5. Equal pay at work is about SO much more than the salary you offer.  If you give dads less paid parental leave than moms
4. I want to reiterate how important it is to give dads full parental leave. I strongly encourage them to take the full time.  I’ve heard the “normal” paternity leave is 2 weeks. That is NOT okay! As my partner says: “What do employers expect those new moms to do? Walk it off?”
3. Our 12 weeks parental leave is up to the parent on how they want to use that time. They don’t have to take all 12 weeks at once - for example
2. Paid parental leave applies to ALL new parents
A few notes on our approach:  1. Expecting a child has nothing to do with our hiring decisions

The way we reject the 0-sum idea that some communities win at the cost of others is by using opportunities to address issues intersectionally - to highlight that Antisemitism
I respectfully disagree. The disproportionate treatment is what is exacerbating the situation.  I think this moment is a good opportunity for an intersectional approach.
None of this is “whataboutism.” Racism and bigotry of all forms is inextricably linked.  When you don’t address them as a system and attempt to pick them apart as though they are distinct and separable issues
The entire PREMISE of a wall is not based in fact.  It’s based in a racist + non-evidence based trope that immigrants are dangerous.  Yet some Dems are willing to “compromise” & spend BILLIONS on a trope because we’ve accepted some kinds of racism as realpolitik in America.
Thanks for clarifying the source tweet.   Treatment is still completely different.
It means not invading an entire nation without end. Doesn’t mean “do nothing
I think that our decision to enter unlimited engagement in Afghanistan
If House leadership is creating a standard & committing to calling a resolution for every incident - whether it’s the Congressional Black Caucus
It’s not zero-sum + we have a serious responsibility to listen to communities when they feel pain.  Where I struggle is how we deal with that pain: the “how” after the “what.”  I also fear brooding resentment
And don’t even get me started on misogyny.   If we called resolutions on sexist statements
I often think about how I work with white or male allies when they say something insensitive.  The 1st thing I do is pull them aside + say “hey
“Calling out” is one of the measures of last resort

It’s not my position to tell people how to feel

Thanks for taking the time. I’m thankful we could share a compassionate and productive conversation that hopefully lays the groundwork for future dialogue.
Thank you Sen. @LuisSepulvedaNY!
- Does the program make selected individuals feel lucky just to be there? - What’s the curriculum? - Big one: Is the org actively learning + adapting their processes based on experiences w/ program members? -What is the org trying to learn and what internal weak spots does it ID?
In my opinion
Yes
We can have ideological differences and that’s fine. But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right
Mind you
If you’re mad that I think people SHOULD KNOW when Dems vote to expand ICE powers

What I DID say was that I had to go back to my district & share the MTR vote to explain why a pro-ICE amendment was slipped into a gun safety law.  Maybe they’re mad bc I don’t believe pro-ICE expansion votes should be cast in the dark

I still live in my hood and literally instagrammed from my apartment tonight. A man was just arrested last week with a stockpile of guns specifically trying to kill me & others
It’s pretty sad that people think low Congressional staff pay is a good thing.  Low pay a big reason why money in politics is a problem - you can make a lot more money becoming a lobbyist & setting up a relationship w/ one
A lot of people commenting don’t know how Congressional salaries work.  Each member is given a set amount that they disburse. GOP has refused to increase budgets in years to give hard-working staff a raise

Folks handling the failed deal treated community w/condescension+disdain for  their legitimate concerns.  I warned early to any & all that surging NYC costs+failing subways are creating major political forces to be reckoned with.  But I don’t know what I’m talking about
There was little in the fuzzy proposal that guaranteed jobs for actual NYers
There’s NO WAY that this deal - one of the biggest giveaways in state history - could possibly have been bad

Actually this cal designation is a permission so he can have access to my Google Cal. Congressional spouses get Gcal access all the time.  Next time check your facts before you tweet nonsense.
I think so. Grassroots community members led + organized the whole effort. Wouldn’t have happened if they weren’t there.
Apparently this is a normal practice
Do you really think these increasingly regular & horrific wildfires & droughts are a coincidence?  That growing regularity of “100-year floods” is an accident?  We are losing our homes & loved ones *now.* 3
Disagree. Progressive Jews in my community have been engaging me in private in an effort to not create infighting. Progressive Muslims in my community are concerned w/ being falsely tagged as anti-Semitic. If we can’t reconcile those things via process then nothing will get done.

It does not mean the treatment + presumption of guilt before a verdict. It does not mean we aim for the most punitive punishment.  It means that in the eyes of the law
As a result
All too often
It’s pretty wild that the GOP can’t decide whether they’re going to run with the conspiracy theory that I’m secretly rich
This stuff is really sad. The GOP is so intellectually bankrupt that they no longer engage to debate issues in good faith

If you want to read more on the issue of monopolies
The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally & economically unsustainable.  We can’t simply accept the cliché that “journalism is dying.”  Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it - and if journalism dies
Gonna keep it 💯: The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies & concentration of ownership.  Healthy democracy *requires* high-quality journalism.  W/o a wide range of independent outlets & the revenue to sustain them
Just passed your name along. Wishing you lots of luck and support in this time 💜

I could’ve sat there quietly as the far right tore me to shreds (they were guaranteed to do so the moment a woman like me won my primary)
I’m uneasy about it too. It’s stressful & scary
It’s a huge win. Obviously there is work to do - there are other money committees (Ways & Means

Do people realize how insanely dangerous of an idea it is to support *this President* in fabricating a “national emergency” over immigrants
At this point those who use the terms “racially tinged” or “racially charged” to describe white supremacy should be prepared to explain why they chose to employ those terms instead of “racist”/“racism.”  If the answer is their own discomfort
For those out of the loop

The American people did not organize the biggest midterm election in ~100 years so their new leaders could sit back as the nation waits in crisis.  Our class was elected for a very specific reason: to lead differently
Let’s refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality.  Right now

It *must* be said in a nuanced conversation that questioning where takes come from is nowhere near the same as undermining the extraordinary work reporters and journalists do as “fake news.”  Helping people understand where these takes come from help guard against those attacks.
I’m not challenging that I was checked - I think the check is a very fair one to masked
(Also: credit for “facts are facts
Another question for @politifact: some officials’ statements (ex. Andrew Cuomo) get rated “true” frequently.  I say true things all the time - I’d hope most do. When does Politifact choose to rate true statements?  Is there a guide? I’d be happy to repost if there is.
Or why did @washingtonpost give my confusing tweet on military accounting offsets the same “Pinocchios” as Trump’s flat denial of how many Americans died in Puerto Rico?  These are legitimate questions not intended to attack. Who makes these decisions? How? Is there a rubric?
For example
