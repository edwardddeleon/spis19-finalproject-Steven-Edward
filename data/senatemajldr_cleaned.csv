"Sickening to learn this morning of another mass murder in Dayton, Ohio overnight. Two horrifying acts of violence in less than 24 hours. We stand with law enforcement as they continue working to keep Americans safe and bring justice."
"The entire nation is horrified by today's senseless violence in El Paso. Elaine's and my prayers go out to the victims of this terrible violence, their families and friends, and the brave first responders who charged into harm’s way."
"My staff and I are closely monitoring this morning’s explosion of a gas transmission pipeline in Lincoln County, Kentucky. Our prayers are with the families whom this disaster has touched and our gratitude is with all the first responders."
"The forces that seek to harm the United States and our interests demand the attention of a fully-equipped, modern and ready military. Passing the bipartisan funding agreement before the Senate today will help us make sure we are up to the task."
"Considering the circumstances of divided government, the government funding agreement that President Trump’s team negotiated is a strong deal. It achieves Republicans’ number one priority: Continuing to fund the rebuilding of our Armed Forces and modernizing our national defense."
Modern-day McCarthyism is poison for American democracy. It is shameful to imply that policy disagreements make the other side unpatriotic. The people who push such unhinged smears are doing Putin’s destabilizing work for him.
Thanks to the leadership of Dan Coats the intelligence community has made a great leap since 2016 to defend our democracy from ongoing Russian interference and the administration’s significant progress in defending against interference in 2018 and preparing us for 2020.
"My friend and former colleague Dan Coats has devoted decades of his life in service to our country. I was reassured knowing that a man who took such a deliberate, thoughtful, and unbiased approach was at the helm of our intelligence community."
The Senate has never failed to attend to the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund and today we will address it again. It will be my honor to vote later today to ensure it has the resources it needs into the future.
The funding agreement between the Trump Administration and Speaker Pelosi secures critical funding to continue rebuilding and modernizing our armed forces. It's the deal that our national defense needs.
I am glad the administration and Speaker Pelosi have reached a two-year funding agreement that secures the resources we need to continue rebuilding our armed forces. The next step is for the House and the Senate to pass this agreement so that President Trump can sign it into law.
President Trump has made an outstanding choice for Secretary of Defense. Mark Esper has played a major role in the administration’s ongoing work to restore our Armed Forces. He's won high praise from experts across the political spectrum. The Senate should confirm him this week.
"This Republican Senate is not going to let damaging far-left ideas become law. We are fighting for all Americans, including the Kentucky miners and everybody else the last administration’s policies left behind. We won't let things like the “Green New Deal” become law."
But some communities are still struggling to dig out from the damage of the Obama years. Republicans are focused on helping them. But prominent Democrats want to return to failed policies like the war on fossil fuels that would harm these communities even further.
Today the American people are experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. Way more job openings than job seekers. An all-American recovery that isn’t limited to just a select few places and industries.
It’s a sad situation when elected members of the Democratic Party are openly urging their leadership not to make them vote on condemning anti-Semitism and the BDS movement. The House should vote on the bipartisan legislation the Senate passed months ago with 77 votes.
I’ll be discussing the Senate’s agenda and the continuing success of the American economy with @MariaBartiromo tomorrow morning on @FoxBusiness at 8 AM EST.
"This week, the senate is considering several important tax treaties with foreign trading partners. These treaties account for trillions of dollars in foreign investments across the country, cultivate robust trading relationships and create certainty for job creators."
"Thanks to Republican policies of the last 2 years, Kentucky is helping lead the charge. I couldn’t be prouder of my home state’s record-breaking low unemployment rate and growth in jobs and investment."
"Kentucky is proud of our diverse economy. Turns out bourbon and horse races are a winning combination. We also take huge pride in manufacturing, agriculture, mining and coal. They keep the lights on in America’s heartland."
"Since January 2017, Republicans in Congress have partnered with the Trump administration to get our nation’s opportunity economy going and growing again for everyone. The results? Unemployment has fallen to near 50-year lows and stayed there."
I am proud of the work our government has done to shore up our defenses of American democracy and deter foreign interference. I'm glad the administration is laser-focused on continuing the progress. Our adversaries aren’t letting up and our preparations are not letting up either.
"Increased agency coordination. Millions of dollars in direct aid to state election officials. Updating election systems. These are just a few of the parts of the ongoing, coordinated federal, state, and local campaign to shore up America’s election security."
"Congratulations to the @USWNT and thanks for giving Americans yet another reason to be proud over the Fourth of July weekend by bringing home the World Cup. The Senate sends our congratulations for your grit, teamwork, and talent."
"On our Independence Day, I am also thinking of the people of Hong Kong, Burma, Venezuela, and so many other places where the struggle for freedom, democracy, and human rights continues to this day."
This amendment would be a radical departure from constitutional traditions and norms. It would weaken American deterrence and diplomacy at a time of heightened tensions caused by Iran’s aggression in the Middle East. The Senate must defeat it.
House Democrats have had eight weeks to pass emergency border funding. All they could pass was a partisan bill that failed in the Senate. The Senate’s bill is overwhelmingly bipartisan and what can be signed into law.
The Senate has just passed a bipartisan emergency appropriations bill for the crisis at the border by an overwhelming 84-8 vote. The House should pass this funding bill right away.
Current events are a stark reminder of the Senate’s responsibility in maintaining our military's readiness. This week we’re considering critical defense legislation that would authorize vital investments in American strength. It deserves huge bipartisan support and swift passage.
"Iran’s aggression, violence, and threats to global commerce affect the entire world. I hope all nations will join the United States and its allies in condemning Tehran and imposing significant consequences for its hostile acts."
It is encouraging to see our neighbors working enthusiastically to make the USMCA a reality. I urge Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to catch up to our neighbors and begin to advance the USMCA.
"I was glad to speak with @JustinTrudeau yesterday. We discussed several important matters that the United States and Canada are tackling together as neighbors and friends, including the USMCA."
"Last night, Iran shot down a U.S. drone that was in international airspace. Just one more reminder about the need for cutting-edge national defense and military readiness. That’s exactly what the defense legislation the Senate is currently considering would help accomplish."
So the Senate is moving forward. Yesterday the Appropriations Committee approved funding for the border crisis on a huge bipartisan margin – 30-1. Now we need to consider this urgent bill on the Senate floor. I hope the needs of our nation will finally win out over partisanship.
"House Democrats have stood by for weeks, doing nothing about the humanitarian crisis on the border. They’ve ignored agencies’ pleas for more funding. Because the far left can hardly bring itself to accomplish anything other than picking fights with the President."
"So today, the Senate is moving forward on the border crisis. The Senate Appropriations Committee just approved a funding package with overwhelming bipartisan support. This a big step toward finally helping our overstretched agencies."
"For seven weeks, House Democrats have delayed the emergency funding that is badly needed for the humanitarian crisis on our southern border. They have chosen to pick political fights with President Trump rather than get serious about finding compromise solutions."
"The Senate is turning to crucial legislation that will strengthen our national defense. It will strengthen our partnerships in the most troubled regions of the world and ensure the U.S. military remains the most prepared, best-equipped, and most lethal fighting force in the world"
"Given the precarious international situations and challenges facing our nation, I’m encouraged that the next Acting Secretary of Defense will be an experienced, tested, and capable leader such as Secretary Esper."
I want to express my admiration for the people of Hong Kong and their strong but peaceful response to this proposed encroachment on their autonomy. I’m glad to see their leaders respect their willingness to stand their ground.
Iran’s corrupt regime must not be rewarded for terror and intimidation by threatening the freedom of navigation in international waters. I support the administration’s prudent efforts for the purpose of defense and deterrence to protect American interests in the Middle East.
"Let there be no doubt: While the United States does not seek conflict, we must be prepared to decisively defeat our adversaries if conflict is forced upon us. We need to remain engaged, prepared, and powerful."
"The National Defense Authorization Act is crucial, bipartisan legislation that will help maintain and expand our alliances and partnerships around the globe, as well as our own ability to stand firm amidst growing global unrest."
It’s inexcusable that Democrats have opposed emergency resources for the border crisis simply because they don’t like the occupant of the White House. “The Resistance” doesn’t pay the bills or keep America safe. I hope my Democratic colleagues can finally get serious soon.
Everyone knows there’s a crisis on our southern border. The officials on the ground. The experts at Homeland Security. The Trump administration. Republicans in Congress. Everybody knows we need to act — except House Democrats who continue to stand in the way of emergency funding.
"Next week, the Senate Appropriations Committee will vote on badly needed funding for humanitarian and security missions on the border. We’ll do what everyone knows must be done. We'll see if our Democratic colleagues are finally ready to put partisanship aside and get to “yes.”"
"We’ve been waiting for six weeks for Democrats to get serious about the crisis on our southern border. The entire country can see the need for more resources, but House Democrats are more focused on picking fights with the president. So Senate Republicans are going to take action"
"Everyone from @POTUS to the New York Times editorial board agrees this funding is urgently needed. If Democrats continue to drag their feet, they will continue to own the unacceptable conditions on our southern border. My colleagues must allow this legislation to move forward."
"We must address the security crisis and humanitarian crisis at the border. The men and women who enforce our laws are overwhelmed. 100,000 apprehensions on a monthly basis. Border facilities are overcrowded and under-equipped. This cannot continue."
"Proud to support the passage of the Debbie Smith Act of 2019, which will provide much-needed resources to state and local law enforcement agencies to help speed up the testing of rape kits and ensure that the perpetrators of sexual assault are brought to justice faster."
"A core feature of this anti-Semitic trend is the BDS movement, a political and economic attack on Israel’s right to exist. In February, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that included a counter-BDS provision. Now the House must do the same."
"There is a rising tide of anti-Semitism in the world, a scourge that is spreading in the Middle East, in Europe and even here in the United States. Political leaders on both sides of the aisle have a responsibility to confront this ugliness head-on."
"I know the entire Senate joins me in holding the victims of yesterday’s shooting in Colorado, their families, and their entire community in our prayers today. And our gratitude is with the first responders, whose swift action saved untold lives."
It’s an honor to join @IRIglobal this evening and receive their 2019 Freedom Award
"These attacks are a tragic reminder of the continuing and global threat posed by terrorists. We stand with Sri Lanka in prayer, in mourning, and in solidarity against this evil enemy."
I’m grieved this Easter Sunday by the horrific terrorist attacks on Christian churches and hotels in Sri Lanka that have killed hundreds and wounded many more.
The @FCC has just announced it will hold a spectrum auction to bolster America’s 5G and invest $20 billion in rural broadband. This is welcome news to my home state of #Kentucky. Thank you to @AjitPaiFCC and @POTUS for these market-based initiatives. #5GFast
Talking to @BretBaier at 6 PM on @FoxNews. Tune in!
This All-American comeback is being helped along by a set of Republican ideas and policies that are the polar opposite of what our Democratic friends are now calling for.
More job openings than Americans looking for work for the first time since record-keeping started. Unemployment at a 49-year low. The fastest wage growth in a decade.
"From the Green New Deal to Medicare for None, it’s ironic that so many Democrats are choosing to pivot to socialism just as Republican policies are helping create an incredible economic moment for the American people."
"Thanks to @SenMcSallyAZ and @SenCoryGardner for their hard work to formalize the drought contingency plan for the Colorado River Basin. Our colleagues from the West have been working with state, local, and tribal leaders for years to develop this bipartisan, bicameral solution."
"Democrats’ “Medicare for None” would slap a $32 trillion tab on Americans, and that’s just a rough estimate for the first decade. And competing private insurance policies -- like the ones that 180 million Americans currently use -- would be banned outright."
"The same Washington D.C. “experts” who brought us Obamacare’s sky-high premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and dysfunction now want to hollow out Medicare and create a government-run plan that every single American would be forced into."
The Senate is building on the action we took last week to restore some reason and sanity to the nominations process. Now we are confirming more of the President’s well-qualified nominees.
"Many Republicans and I supported a similar rules change when Democrats proposed it during the Obama administration, back in 2013. It passed easily with 78 votes. I hope my Democratic colleagues likewise join with us next week to take this needed step."
Thanks @IvankaTrump for visiting @Toyota and its workers in #Kentucky to discuss our economy and workforce. @Toyota continues to be a truly great partner to #Kentucky & we're proud to be the home of its largest vehicle plant in the world.
So out of the ash heap of history came this talk of “court-packing.” A radical proposal that had been dead and buried by bipartisan consensus for almost a century.
"The idea that Democrats sometimes lose presidential elections, and that Republican presidents sometimes subsequently appoint Supreme Court justices, is apparently no longer to be tolerated."
"When our Constitution and our institutions disappoint Democrats, they apparently decide that it’s the ground rules that need to change – not their extreme positions."
Senate Democrats introduced a bill yesterday that would rewrite the rules of politics to benefit their party. Some are even talking about “packing” the Supreme Court.
My home state of Kentucky and many other states are bearing heavy burdens in the wake of powerful natural disasters. The Senate is currently considering a package of supplemental disaster relief funds to address the most urgent needs of America’s heartland.
And they’ll see which senators are so fully committed to radical left-wing ideology that they can’t even vote “no” on self-inflicted economic ruin that would take a sledgehammer to America’s middle class.
"Later today, the American people will see which of their senators can do the common-sense thing and vote “no” on this destructive socialist daydream."
It’s remarkable to see a party coalesce around a proposal to forcibly remake the entire country on the whims of Brooklyn and San Francisco. But it’s been even more stunning to see my Democrat colleagues angry and upset that the plan they support is about to get a vote.
"The Green New Deal, my Democratic colleagues’ rallying cry: Killing off entire domestic industries. Winding down millions of jobs. Basically outlawing the only sources of energy that working-class and middle-class families can actually afford."
"We must all remember: Small flames of anger and hostility are nothing in comparison to the bright, shining light of Americans’ love and support for the state of Israel."
"Nobody in American politics, nobody in America should need reminding that anti-Semitism is uniquely destructive."
So I am troubled that leading Democrats seem to have some difficulty plainly calling out anti-semitism within their own ranks. And I am troubled that many of the declared Democrat presidential candidates seem to be avoiding @AIPAC this year.
"It may be that anti-semitic views are limited to a small fringe today. But if ancient slurs and sanders are left unchallenged, they will be normalized anew."
"Remember, to the Mullahs in Tehran, the United States and Israel are the “Great Satan” and “Little Satan.” Our enemies group us together because we are cut from similar cloth. And frankly that should be a point of pride for all of us."
"Supporting Israel is not some conspiracy, or part of some hidden agenda supported by money and ""dual loyalties"".  A shared history and common values draw America and Israel together. Not to mention our mutual adversaries who hate us for our principles and pluralism."
"I could not be more glad that the American people will have the opportunity to learn precisely where each one of their senators stand on the “Green New Deal”: a radical, top-down, socialist makeover of the entire U.S. economy."
Today and every day I miss my good friend John McCain. It was a blessing to serve alongside a rare patriot and genuine American hero in the Senate. His memory continues to remind me every day that our nation is sustained by the sacrifices of heroes.
"With the “Green New Deal,” Democrats have simply taken the debunked socialist ideas of the last century, rolled them into one giant package, and thrown a little “green” paint on them to make them look new."
"Apparently, Democrats think seniors want Medicare hollowed out until nothing’s left but the name. That working families are eager to be kicked off the health plans they chose and forced into a one-size-fits-all government system. No choices. No options. Just “Medicare for none”."
"The new House Democrat majority has wasted no time rolling out one half-baked, socialist proposal after another. Apparently the economic growth sweeping across America hasn’t convinced Democrats that things go pretty well without oppressive supervision from Washington."
"I was especially encouraged to see @POTUS’ commitment to our nation’s #veterans in his budget proposal, including my request to fully fund construction of the new Robley Rex VA Medical Center in Louisville, #Kentucky."
Nothing encapsulates the Democrat’s hard left turn towards socialism more than the “Green New Deal”. One estimate pegs the cost of this centrally-planned nightmare at around $93 trillion. That’s more than every dollar our federal government has spent in its entire history to date
Racial and religious hate mongering deserves swift condemnation. I’m glad the House of Representatives is taking up a resolution to reject antisemitism. But I’m sorry it had to be prompted by the repeated invocation of hurtful stereotypes by a Democratic member of the House.
"Our relationship and support for @Israel is built on common values and democratic principles. On shared interests, close partnerships, and deep friendships. The members of the Senate support Israel because so many Americans support Israel."
"Taxing more, spending more, and seizing more power away from the people. That is the Democrats’ hammer of choice -- and in every part of American life they see a nail. They’re sprinting as far left as possible, trying to outdo one another."
"Over the weekend, @SenShelby became the longest-serving senator in Alabama’s history. Congratulations to our Appropriations Chairman and the senior senator from Alabama. He’s delivered results for his state and the nation for years."
"Democrats’ “Medicare for all” bill would end Medicare as we know it and force everyone into a single government-run system. The plans that more than 170 million Americans currently rely on would be made illegal. No choice, no options, and no alternatives allowed."
The President should be commended for his personal commitment to persuading Kim Jong Un to pursue a different path -- and for walking away when it became clear North Korea was not ready to commit enough to de-nuclearization.
I’m grateful to the first responders working around the clock to keep communities safe from severe weather throughout #Kentucky. My staff and I are ready to work with emergency management officials and will continue to monitor this situation closely.
Today the Senate will vote on a straightforward piece of legislation to protect newborn babies. Let's be clear: The human rights of newborn boys and girls are innate. They don’t come and go based on the circumstances of birth.  A newborn baby is a newborn baby. Period.
"The Senate has just confirmed William Barr to be Attorney General of the United States. I’m confident he will be a strong, independent, and principled advocate for fairness and for following the law."
We’ll be voting to secure our nation’s borders and keeping American communities safe. And we’ll do it free from the influence of poison pills that sought to derail progress and stifle compromise.
"When the Senate votes on the agreement to fund the government, we’ll be voting to avoid a second partial shutdown and provide the certainty of a fully-functioning federal government."
"We can’t let any unrelated, cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing the important process of funding the government and securing the border. The agreement reached on Monday was achieved because the conference committee set aside far-left poison pills and absurd demands"
House democrats are apparently objecting to a modest extension of the Violence against Women Act. Republicans believe we should extend this important legislation #VAWA
"The new agreement provides new funds for miles of border barriers and it completes all seven outstanding appropriations bills, so Congress can complete a funding process for all the outstanding parts of the federal government with predictability and certainty."
"It had been clear to everyone that, in order to reach an agreement, our Democratic colleagues would have to walk away from two extreme positions that had been dictated to them by the far left. I’m glad they did."
"I want to thank and congratulate our colleagues who have been working hard to secure a bipartisan, bicameral solution to complete the appropriations process and fund the government."
Every eligible American voter should be completely free to exercise their right to vote at every opportunity and cast a ballot. Every single valid vote should be counted. The Democrat Politician Protection Act would not fix problems with our elections – it would exacerbate them.
"The Natural Resources Management Act is a broad, bipartisan package that tackles conservation, economic development and land access issues of importance to nearly every member of this body. I look forward to it passing soon."
William Barr has been confirmed by the Senate three times without opposition. He has the experience and is eminently qualified to perform the duties of Attorney General. I hope and expect he will be confirmed next week.
"As I’ve said time and time again: Mindless obstruction is unacceptable.  The only way this divided Congress will be able to choose greatness and deliver significant legislation is by focusing on -- as President Trump put it -- “cooperation, compromise, and the common good.”"
"To tackle these challenges, the American people deserve the full attention of a fully-functioning Congress. They deserve a Democratic Party that puts the public interest ahead of political spite and comes to the table to negotiate necessary compromises."
"The President also highlighted some national challenges -- like addressing the humanitarian and security crisis on our border, rebuilding American infrastructure, lowering healthcare costs and fighting on behalf of American workers and job creators."
"Last night, President Trump shared a hopeful vision of a bright future for America. He reminded us that, in part, that future is bright because of recent years’ big achievements: Tax reform, regulatory reform, landmark legislation to combat the opioid epidemic, and more."
The Senate just passed the Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act. I’m especially proud it includes my amendment reaffirming the importance of our nation’s ongoing missions in Afghanistan and Syria.
"It's been more than two years since the American people hired President Trump and a Republican Congress to get Washington’s foot off the brake of our economy. Since we got to work rebuilding middle class prosperity, it's been an all-American comeback."
From historic tax reform and regulatory reform... to huge progress in the fight against ISIS… to landmark progress in the nationwide fight against opioid addiction... the story of the last two years has been one of immense policy progress for our nation.
"Tonight, the Congress will host @POTUS for his State of the Union address. I’m looking forward to attending and hearing the President reflect on the great strides our nation has made over the past two years and his vision for the challenges still before us. #SOTU"
"The Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act would renew our commitment to Israel’s security, expand cooperation with Jordan, and impose new consequences on the perpetrators of Assad’s brutality in Syria."
The United States of America has never been about centralizing all power in Washington D.C. And Washington should not get to micromanage the processes that determine who comes to Washington.
Democrats’ H.R. 1 (the Democrat Politician Protection Act) proposes a massive federal takeover of elections. But neither the facts nor the opinions of American voters show any evidence of a crisis or emergency that would make this unprecedented step necessary.
My amendment to S.1 would allow Senators to go on the record about what the United States should be doing in Syria and Afghanistan. ISIS and al Qaeda have yet to be defeated and American national security interests require continued commitment to our missions there.
This legislation also includes the bipartisan Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. It makes a crystal-clear statement to the murderous regime of Bashar Al-Assad and those who abet it: Your brutality needs to end.
It deepens our partnership with Jordan as it faces an unprecedented humanitarian challenge from the chaos in Syria.
"This vital legislation tells our ally @Israel that our commitment to their security is ironclad. It authorizes military assistance, loan guarantees and teamwork on missile defense."
"Today, the Senate will vote to advance a package of important foreign policy legislation that will advance our national security priorities in the Middle East. I hope my democratic colleagues will finally join us in advancing these widely-supported bipartisan bills."
"On International Holocaust Rememberance day, #WeRemember the six million Jews who were murdered. Let us honor their memories by working together to ensure these horrors never happen again."
"Today, the Senate will be voting on a proposal to end the government shutdown. It would resume pay for federal workers, and strike a bipartisan compromise on the issue of immigration and border security. And it provides stable, full-year funding for the federal government."
Enough political spite. Enough showboating for “the Resistance.” The President has produced a fair compromise that pairs full-year government funding with immigration policy priorities from both sides. It’s time to make a deal.
The proposal outlined by @POTUS would reopen the government fully. It is the only proposal currently before us that can be signed by the President and immediately reopen the government.
"Today, our nation unites to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We should keep striving for the mutual respect, shared brotherhood, and national unity to which Dr. King so powerfully called us. #MLKDay"
"Today D.C. is hosting one of our nation’s proudest examples of peaceful activism, the #MarchForLife. I want to thank the marchers, especially my fellow Kentuckians, for bearing witness to human dignity and demanding respect for all life. @March_for_Life @KentuckyRTL"
"We Republicans are hardly strangers to the need for strong policies concerning Russia. We have long seen Vladimir Putin for the KGB thug he is. Just ask Senator @MittRomney, who only six years ago was mocked by the other side for advocating tough policies against the Kremlin."
The Democratic Leader said the Senate shouldn’t do any business during this partial government shutdown. But apparently he didn’t actually mean it. Because now the Democratic Leader would like to dictate the terms of a debate on Russia.
I made it our first priority to move legislation that would have helped defend Israel and Jordan and provide justice for Syrians who have been tortured and murdered by the Assad regime. But Democrats have repeatedly blocked that important legislation.
"Democrats may continue to cynically filibuster bipartisan bills to support Israel, defend Jordan and provide justice for innocent Syrians, but Republicans will not abandon the need for American leadership in the world."
Enforcing our laws has not become unethical overnight. The physical barriers at the border that Democrats supported yesterday have not somehow become a radical right-wing position today. Border security still matters. American families still deserve safety.
"If she believes that enforcing our immigration laws with physical barriers is immoral, will the Speaker be introducing a bill to destroy the walls and fencing that already exist?"
"Is Speaker Pelosi calling sitting Senate Democrats immoral? Many of them voted to invest billions in border security, including physical barriers, over the past few years alone."
Speaker Pelosi called a border barrier “an immorality.” Was it immoral for Democrats to vote for the Secure Fence Act in 2006? Was it immoral for President Obama’s administration to build the same kind of steel-slat barriers that President Trump now wants to expand?
"The chaos created by the Assad regime has made Syria a graveyard for innocent civilians, and a base for Iran and Russia to spread their malign influence through the region. The Senate will vote on a bipartisan basis to tackle the Syrian crisis head-on."
"Congratulations to Senator @ChuckGrassley, just elected the Senate’s new President Pro Tempore. I’m glad that our new colleagues and the entire Senate will continue learning from your example."
"Welcome @MarshaBlackburn, Mike Braun, @SenKevinCramer, Josh Hawley, @SenMcSallyAZ, @SenatorRomney, @SenJackyRosen, @SenatorSinema to the US Senate #116thCongress"
The Senate has reached an agreement to confirm more of the Administration’s well-qualified nominees. I’m glad these newly-confirmed nominees will be able to get to work on important business for the American people.
"Democrats will have to get serious about border security so that a government funding agreement can pass the House, earn 60 votes in the Senate, and receive a presidential signature. All three of these things are needed. One partisan vote in the House won't solve anything."
"I’m glad productive discussions are continuing between our Democratic colleagues and the White House. When those negotiations produce a solution that can pass the Senate and the House and receive @POTUS’s signature, it will receive a vote on the Senate floor."
Let’s not end this year the way it began: Another shutdown over the issue of illegal immigration because the Democrats are unwilling to support common-sense measures. I am proud to vote for the additional border security that the House added to government funding legislation.
"Later this morning, we’ll introduce a continuing resolution that will ensure continuous funding for the federal government. The measure will provide the resources necessary to continue normal operations through February 8th."
General John Kelly has served the president and the nation with great distinction. The Marine Corps is stronger for John Kelly’s years of leadership. America is better for his distinguished career of service. I extend my deep gratitude for his job well done.
"As the entire nation mourned the loss of Sen. John McCain, Jon Kyl volunteered his even keel and sound judgement to serve Arizona. I am grateful for this second opportunity to work alongside such a dear friend."
"I want to thank @JeffFlake for his service. As part of this Senate majority, he’s had a hand in many policy accomplishments that have tangibly made life better for Arizonans and the nation."
"When President Trump signs the #FarmBill into law, it will be a big win for farmers in Kentucky and across our country. Farming families deserve more stability, and that is precisely what they will have."
It strengthens protections for victims. It ensures that it is members of Congress who will be held responsible for their own misconduct -- not taxpayers. Thank you @SenAmyKlobuchar and @RoyBlunt for working hard to get this done.
The Senate and the House have reached a landmark agreement to reform the process by which Capitol Hill handles claims of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. It is a bicameral and bipartisan agreement.
I’m sad to bid farewell to a living example of the American dream at its most extraordinary. @senorrinhatch has been the longest-serving Republican Senator in our nation’s history. I wish him a peaceful and happy retirement.
"The Senate took a major step yesterday by passing the Farm Bill, which will deliver a big shot in the arm to farmers and rural communities. I’m especially proud it will open a new door for industrial #hemp farmers in #Kentucky and around the country."
"At a time when farm income is down and growers are struggling, industrial hemp is a bright spot of agriculture’s future. My provision in the Farm Bill will not only legalize domestic hemp, but it will also allow state departments of agriculture to be responsible for its oversight"
Senate Republicans are working with the President and his Homeland Security team on $5.02 billion of targeted funding to bolster security measures at the US-Mexico border.
"At the request of the president and following improvements to the legislation that have been secured by several members, the Senate will take up the recently revised Criminal Justice bill this month."
". @SenBobCorker has been a brilliant Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has been a powerful voice for American interests and our allies, and a thorn in the side of those who might wish us harm. The Senate will miss his enthusiasm and expertise."
"Coal deserves a level playing field, not runaway regulation that will do little to actually help the environment. I applaud @POTUS and @EPA to end the War on Coal and bring relief to hardworking Kentucky families."
"With needless delays- & a record-breaking number of cloture votes on nominations, my Democratic colleagues have made this body drag its feet along the way. But the Senate will press on this week to put to rest more of the people’s business before the close of the 115th Congress."
"The Senate is focused on wrapping up this year’s remaining priorities: getting more of the president’s team in place, confirming well-qualified nominees to our federal courts, and attending to the pressing legislative business the American people expect us to handle."
Some of this Congress' biggest accomplishments have been bipartisan. From landmark opioids legislation to improvements in veterans’ services to historic progress on appropriations. Our remaining work on nominations and legislation will require more of that bipartisan spirit.
"Even after two historic years full of accomplishments for the American people, there are still important items left for this Congress to check off our list before the end of this year."
"We’ll continue to make nominations a top priority, as we have this entire Congress. The nominees we’ll consider this week are highly regarded and well equipped for public service. I look forward to confirming each of them without further undue delay."
"As the 115th Congress comes to a close, my colleagues will have much to be proud of. But we aren’t finished yet. The Senate still has a full slate of important business that we must complete before the end of the year."
"Marshaling resources against the opioid crisis, reforming Dodd Frank, funding our armed forces, taking care of our veterans, and improving the nation’s infrastructure are some of the things we have done in this Congress on a bipartisan basis."
"Yesterday’s Coast Guard reauthorization was just the latest installment in a long list of bipartisan successes passed by this Senate, in this Congress, on behalf of the American people."
The Senate just passed legislation to reauthorize @USCG funding to ensure that the brave men and women who put themselves in harm’s way every single day have access to the resources they need.
"It is my honor to have been asked by my colleagues to continue serving as leader. Not a day goes by when I am not humbled and honored by this opportunity to serve my colleagues, the institution of the Senate, and our incredible country in whatever measure I am capable."
"The Senate is back and continuing to work hard for the American people.  We will pass legislation on a bipartisan basis that will reauthorize funding for @USCG to help continue its important work. Great news for #Kentucky – 13,000 jobs depends on the state’s inland waterways."
It provides states the tools they need to improve access to treatment and encourages educational programs in schools to help prevent addiction. It invests in the development of non-addictive painkillers and in research of mental-health factors that may contribute to addiction.
"Good news: @POTUS just signed the “SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act,” a landmark #opioids bill that includes new programs to keep families safe. The bill takes steps to stop illegal drugs and synthetic opioids from crossing the border."
"Thanks to the hard work of @chuckgrassley and the @senjudiciary Committee, we’ve been able to confirm 84 of @POTUS’ judges during this Congress to lifetime appointments on the federal bench—including two Supreme Court Justices and a record number of circuit court judges.  #SCOTUS"
Nearly one out of every six circuit court of appeals judges has been appointed by @POTUS and confirmed by this Republican Senate
"The Senate has confirmed President Trump’s judicial nominees at a historic pace – 84 total, including Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, 29 circuit judges, and 53 district court judges."
"The Senate’s list of accomplishments keeps growing. Water #infrastructure, FAA reauthorization, and a landmark #opioids bill are the latest additions to the accomplishments of the 115th Congress."
"Our economic boom is not “Armageddon,” or “crumbs,” or “disaster,” as some have suggested. It is rising wages, more job opportunities, and new investment. The real winners here are the American people. Republicans are just proud our policies are helping them do what they do best."
Unemployment in America has now fallen to 3.7 percent. That’s our lowest unemployment rate since 1969. Let's be clear: Government itself is not creating this prosperity. Republicans know that growth starts with workers and entrepreneurs.
"America’s Water Infrastructure Act is a major step toward meeting the challenge of improving our nation’s infrastructure. From dams, levees, and flood control to safer drinking water and sewage systems, this legislation meets all sorts of pressing needs."
"Saturday’s vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh was also a victory for the Senate, and for the integrity of our institution. Justice Kavanaugh will be a thoughtful, fair-minded justice who’s committed to applying our laws and Constitution as they are actually written."
"This week we’ll be voting on America’s Water Infrastructure Act, another major victory for American infrastructure under this Congress. Thank you @SenJohnBarrasso and @SenatorCarper for getting this important, bipartisan legislation across the finish line."
I’ll be on the @IngrahamAngle program talking about Judge Kavanaugh tonight at 10 PM ET. #ConfirmKavanaugh
"Today, we can send a message to the American people that some core principles remain unfettered by the partisan passions of this moment. Facts matter. Fairness matters."
"We will either give notice that totally uncorroborated allegations are now, officially, enough to destroy an American’s life - or we will declare that our society cannot, must not, set the bar so low."
"We will either state that facts and evidence can be brushed aside when politically inconvenient, and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics - or we will stand up and say that serious, thoughtful, fact-based deliberation must still define this body."
"When we vote later this morning, we will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly-qualified judge to our highest court. Not anymore. Not after all this. The United States Senate will also be making a statement."
"The Senate will be in session at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Under the regular order, the vote to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court will be at 10:30."
I was proud to file cloture on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination yesterday evening. And I will be proud to vote to advance his nomination tomorrow.
"When the noise fades, what’s left is a distinguished nominee with a unanimously well qualified rating from the American Bar Association (the Democrats’ gold standard). A man whom peers and colleagues praise in the strongest terms. That’s Judge Kavanaugh."
"The FBI has completed yet another background investigation on Judge Kavanaugh and delivered its results to the Senate. The fact is that these allegations have not been corroborated. Not in the new FBI investigation, not anywhere."
I just filed cloture on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. There will be plenty of time for Members to review and be briefed on this supplemental material before a Friday cloture vote.
"Does anyone really think that the same people who called Judge Kavanaugh “evil” long before they heard one word of testimony will be satisfied? It’s time to put this embarrassing spectacle behind us, and vote on this impressive, stunningly qualified Supreme Court nominee."
"This body and this nation have spent months watching my friends across the aisle grasp at every imaginable excuse to delay this process and damage this nominee. If they had their way, the goalposts on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination would be in another time zone by now."
"After the FBI shares what they’ve found, Senators will have the opportunity to vote. We’ll have the opportunity to vote “no” on the politics of personal destruction. We’ll have the opportunity to vote “yes” on this fine nominee."
"Democrats’ mishandling of Dr. Ford’s letter opened the floodgates for a deluge of uncorroborated, unbelievable mud from others. And the mudslide was cheered on, and capitalized on by the far left that has been so eager to stop this nomination. Just politics? I don't think so."
"Democrats may be trying to move the goalposts every five minutes, but their goal has not moved an inch. They will not be satisfied unless they bring down Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination."
The Democratic Leader and the ranking Democrat on the Committee both said recently that an FBI investigation can be completed in less than a week. Let me make a small prediction -- soon enough the goalposts will be on the move once again.
The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close. Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee. We're considering it here on the floor. And we'll be voting this week.
"The confirmation process for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, one of the most qualified and most impressive Supreme Court nominees in our nation’s history, is moving forward."
Brett Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified and most impressive Supreme Court nominees in memory. This is a nomination that deserves to move forward -- and that is precisely what is happening.
"Earlier today, our colleagues on @senjudiciary concluded their thorough, months-long consideration of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination and voted to advance it to the Senate floor with a favorable recommendation."
"Today, with the unanimous support of my conference, the Senate will proceed to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States."
"Democratic colleagues did not treat Dr. Ford or her allegation with the seriousness and discretion she deserved. At the 11th hour, when its introduction was certain to introduce further delay, they got it to the press. So much for Dr. Ford’s request for confidentiality, I guess."
Senate Democrats ignored Dr. Ford’s request for discretion and confidentiality and cheered on a public smear campaign based on uncorroborated allegations. I’m grateful to @ChuckGrassley for handling this with seriousness and responsibility and scheduling Thursday’s hearing.
"One side is handling these sensitive matters with dignity, with professionalism… by the book. And we have another side that chose to sit on allegations and keep them secret until they were leaked to the press."
"The American people know sexual misconduct is serious. They expect this matter to be treated seriously. That’s what @ChuckGrassley has done and is doing. He has acted transparently in the pursuit of truth, and he has treated this matter with kindness and respect. @senjudiciary"
Let’s put aside the last-minute smears. Let’s return to the facts. Let’s have a fair hearing on Thursday.
It remains beyond reasonable dispute that Judge Kavanaugh’s legal brilliance and excellence on the bench make him one of the very most qualified Supreme Court nominees in memory.
"Hundreds of men and women who have known Brett Kavanaugh across his life have written or spoken out that he is a man of strong character and tremendous integrity. Numerous witnesses testified that Brett Kavanaugh is a trusted mentor, and a lifelong champion of women."
Here are the facts before us: This is an allegation of misconduct which all four supposed witnesses either flatly contradict or are unable to back up. It’s not just one alleged witness disagreeing with the allegations -- it’s literally every person who was supposedly there.
"Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man’s personal and professional life on the basis of unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations. This is a smear campaign, pure and simple…aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate."
G’Mar Tov. And may you have an easy fast to all observing Yom Kippur.
"The Senate just passed a crucial appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year. It fully funds vital priorities for defense, education and healthcare."
Next week Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh will testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath. But we should not have gotten to this point. That this process has played out with so little order and so little sensitivity lies solely at the feet of Senate Democrats.
The Senate has just passed the landmark Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018. This legislation is a big additional step to help combat this nationwide epidemic. #CAREERAct
The Senate stands with all those affected by hurricane #florence and we stand ready to ensure communities in the storm’s path have the resources they need to recover and rebuild.
"Judge Kavanaugh demonstrated the intellectual brilliance and thoughtful temperament for which he is so widely known.  He showed exactly why he is universally acknowledged as a leading legal mind, and exactly why he will make a phenomenal Associate Justice of the Supreme Court."
"Last week, the nation watched the president’s outstanding Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, testify before the Judiciary Committee. They saw Chairman @ChuckGrassley guide the committee with gracious, strong leadership and an incredible amount of patience."
"I’m so pleased this landmark legislation includes two of my bills - the CAREER Act, to help individuals in recovery transition back into the workforce and access housing services, and step up accountability on federal efforts to combat addiction among pregnant mothers."
"The Opioid Crisis Response Act will cut the supply of illegal drugs that pour over our borders, make it easier for communities to invest in recovery efforts, extend a helping hand to families and caregivers, and provide for the longer-term medical innovation we need."
The Senate will vote to advance the nomination of Charles Rettig to serve as Commissioner of the IRS. This nomination comes at a crucial time as the federal government continues to implement once-in-a-generation tax reform.
"On appropriations, this week’s bills contain $147 billion for projects ranging from infrastructure improvements, environmental cleanup, military family housing and nuclear security. These are national priorities with local impacts in every one of our states."
"I want to thank Chairman @ChuckGrassley for leading @senjudiciary through a thorough, transparent examination of Judge Kavanaugh’s qualifications. The Senate is fortunate to have a fair, gracious, and dedicated public servant at the helm of this important process."
Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial temperament and brilliance were on full display during this week’s hearings. It’s easy to see why he is widely viewed as one of the finest legal minds in the nation. He will make an excellent Supreme Court Justice.
The Senate confirmed 8 more of @POTUS’s judicial nominees today.
"Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an impressive, brilliant and mainstream nominee. He gave thoughtful, expansive answers while also respecting the independence of the judiciary. I look forward to more excellent testimony from Judge Kavanaugh today."
Looking forward to being on Special Report with @BretBaier at 6 PM EST tonight.
"I’m happy that our colleagues have chosen @JimInhofe to serve as the next chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He possesses rich experience on the committee, including decades of work on behalf of American servicemembers, as well as his own military service."
The American Bar Association “has determined by a unanimous vote that Judge Kavanaugh is ‘Well Qualified’ for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court” – its highest possible rating. Leading Democrats’ have called this the Gold Standard.
"It is only right that today, near the end of his long journey, John lies here -- in this great hall, under this mighty dome, like other American heroes before him. Here, as a “restless wave” approaches the shores of eternity, we thank God for giving this country John McCain."
"John McCain had America’s fighting spirit, our noble idealism, our solemn patriotism, and our slightly irreverent streak -- all rolled into one."
"The Senate’s having a productive summer. We’ve passed appropriations that cover 87% of next year’s discretionary spending. We’ve authorized resources for our armed forces in a bill named for Sen. McCain. And this month, we’ve confirmed eight more of @POTUS’s judicial nominees"
"I’ve announced the formation of a bipartisan ‘gang’ to come up with a suitable, lasting tribute to the legacy of our friend @SenJohnMcCain"
"Very sad to hear this morning’s update from the family of our dear friend @SenJohnMcCain. We are so fortunate to call him our friend and colleague. John, Cindy, and the entire McCain family are in our prayers at this incredibly difficult hour."
"In my home state of Kentucky, we’re looking forward to increased funding for Pell Grants, and the millions we’ve secured to support work colleges like @bereacollege and @ALCeagles."
"This continues to be a productive August in the US Senate. Funding @DeptofDefense, @USDOL, @HHSGov, and @usedgov will make America stronger - overseas and right here at home."
That’s why I announced today that the Senate will continue working through August until another set of @POTUS’s nominees is completely confirmed.
"We’re funding more resources for treatment, prevention, and recovery programs to address the opioid epidemic. There’s over $100 million in targeted help for rural communities -- like those in Kentucky -- which continue to bear the brunt of this national crisis."
"The Senate’s funding for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education will provide $220 million for dislocated workers, with a special $30 million emphasis on displaced workers in rural communities, like those I represent in Eastern and Western Kentucky"
"I’m proud that, on this Congress’s watch, our economy has produced so many job opportunities. That growth and prosperity need to reach all families and all communities. The appropriation measures the Senate is considering this week invest in human capital from all angles."
"During the Obama years, West Virginia’s economy was hit hard. But today, the state’s unemployment rate has been lower during each of the past 19 months under this united Republican government than it was during any month of the Obama administration."
Getting this legislation done for the men and women who wear the uniform was one of our top priorities.
"The NDAA authorizes the resources that our men and women in uniform depend on, from Ft. Knox and Ft. Campbell in my home state of Kentucky to installations around the country -- and around the world."
"Today, @POTUS signed the John S. McCain 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. It gives U.S. servicemembers a raise and authorizes vital programs for our nation’s defense. I’m very proud of this legislation."
"This good economic news is an inconvenient truth for Senate Democrats, who have opposed our pro-growth policies. But the rest of America isn’t hiding from these numbers. We’re celebrating them."
We learned last week that second quarter real GDP growth exceeded 4%. That’s the best quarterly growth rate in four years and one of the strongest reports since the Great Recession.
What’s really startling is when prominent Democrat leaders let far-left talking points form the basis for their own policy positions. Senate Democrats advocating to #AbolishICE? @JohnCornyn had it right: “Get a grip.”
"The #AbolishICE movement has said our nation would be better off with no borders and no immigration laws. Period. But the American people know @ICEgov’s mission is essential, and the nation is better for it."
"Today, Vice President Pence is visiting West Virginia to discuss Republicans’ pro-growth agenda. The state’s unemployment rate has been lower every month under this united Republican government than it was in any month under President Obama."
"Today, w/ help from a united GOP government, job creators are back doing what they do best. The number of Americans saying now is a good time to find a quality job is at a 17-year high. And the number filing for new unemployment benefits is at a 48-year low. Results > rhetoric."
"Rhetoric vs. Results: Pres. Obama said “the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America’s businesses.” But his administration set two all-time records for pages in the Federal Register, including many burdensome regulations that tied job creators’ hands."
"I’m proud of the continued hard work of Chairman @SenShelby, @SenatorLeahy, and subcommittee leaders @lisamurkowski, @SenatorCollins, @SenJohnHoeven, and @SenatorLankford for managing this bipartisan appropriations process."
The appropriations measures being considered by the Senate this week cover about 1/8th of federal govt. discretionary spending for the coming year. They include resources for pressing national needs like rebuilding America’s infrastructure and confronting the opioid epidemic.
"Now, less than two years into this united Republican government, the results are different. An all-time high 95.1% of manufacturers have a positive outlook, and two-thirds plan to hire in the coming year."
"For years, President Obama and Democrats in Congress talked about getting U.S. manufacturing moving. Rhetoric was never in short supply. But results were hard to come by: During the last administration, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs on net."
"This year, Chairman @SenShelby and @SenatorLeahy have led a bipartisan appropriations process through subcommittee and full committee work. I hope we can continue that same cooperative spirit on the Senate floor to achieve our shared goals for the American people."
"The Senate remembers USCP Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, killed in the line of duty 20 years ago today. We renew our condolences to their families. We are grateful for them and for all who wear the uniform in harm’s way."
"In Robert Wilkie, @POTUS has chosen a Secretary of Veterans’ Affairs with whom the Senate can work side-by-side to continue advancing the interests of America’s veterans. I was proud to vote, along with the overwhelming, bipartisan majority of my colleagues, to confirm him today."
"Wishing a very happy 95th birthday to my friend, @SenatorDole. Bob has built an extraordinary life, grounded in ordinary American values. Today, and every day, we are grateful for his service."
Judge Kavanaugh’s apparent comments would be in line with mainstream views that have been strongly held across the political spectrum – including by Senate Democrats themselves.
"A bipartisan majority agreed to let the flawed “independent counsels” statute expire in 1999. It has nothing to do with special counsels, or any of the other tools currently in place for holding elected officials accountable."
The left’s latest made-up controversy is an attempt to make political hay out of comments Judge Kavanaugh made about the long-ago expired “independent counsels” statute. But here are the facts:
"This week, even more of our colleagues have come away impressed after meeting with @POTUS’ #SCOTUS nominee, Judge Kavanaugh. But far-left special interests continue grasping at straws and trying to smear this nominee any way they can."
"This week, the Senate is confirming impressive nominees whom @POTUS has asked to serve our country. Two Asst. Secretaries for the Department of Education. A member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Nominees for the Fifth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals."
"I’m glad that this step by @IRSnews will make the right of Americans to freely advocate for their strongly-held beliefs less vulnerable to the malice of some in government, and to the proven failures of bureaucracies."
"In this country, good government means protecting citizens’ First Amendment rights to participate in the competition of ideas – not trying to shut down that competition."
"Last night, @IRSnews announced that it’s cutting back on the amount of nonpublic information the government collects and stockpiles about Americans who donate to nonprofit causes. It’s particularly welcome news for those of us dedicated to defending the First Amendment."
"But now that Democrats know his name, their attacks haven’t gotten any less hysterical. One flavor of the week: misrepresenting his decades-old writings. Perfect conspiracy theory catnip for their far-left base. The only problem? It wasn’t true. #SCOTUS"
"Even before he was nominated for #SCOTUS, Judge Kavanaugh was subjected to “fill in the blank” opposition. @POTUS hadn’t even named his selection, and already, our entire system of government was on its last legs? Give me a break."
"Judge Kavanaugh seems to impress everyone with whom he crosses paths -- at least those who haven’t blindly announced, in a fit of partisanship, their opposition to this nomination before he was even named. #SCOTUS"
"Judge Kavanaugh is the real deal. An extensive judicial record defined by fairness, thoughtfulness, and thoroughness. @POTUS has made an outstanding choice."
"Judge Kavanaugh compiled an extensive record on the federal bench, publishing more than 300 opinions, and earning considerable praise for his clear writing and reasoning. It gives us a clear picture of how he would conduct himself on the #SCOTUS."
"Judges need to be unbiased. They need to treat all parties fairly. They need to approach every case with open ears and an open mind. By all accounts, Judge Kavanaugh is precisely that sort of judge. #SCOTUS"
"Americans see beyond the far-left fear mongering. Senators should do the same. We should evaluate @POTUS’s nominee fairly, based on their qualifications. And we should treat this process with the respect and the dignity that it deserves. #SCOTUSNomination"
Our Democratic colleagues cry wolf whenever a Republican president nominates anyone to the Supreme Court. No matter their qualifications. No matter their record.  No matter their reputation. It’s the same hyperbole.  The same accusations. The same old story. #SCOTUSnominee
"American farm communities need stability and predictability, and they need it urgently. The time has come to deliver. The farm bill is too important a subject to keep our farmers and their families waiting."
"All week, I’ve highlighted some of the ways the farm bill will support the family farmers whose harvest feeds America and supplies the world. It’s an understatement to say this bill comes at an opportune time."
I’m confident Chairman Grassley will capably lead the Judiciary Committee through the confirmation process that lies before us.
"As I stated yesterday, the Senate stands ready to fulfill our constitutional role by offering advice and consent on @POTUS' nominee to fill the #SCOTUS vacancy that Justice Kennedy’s retirement will create."
"If you pick up a local paper in almost any state from Montana to Florida, you’ll find that Americans are paying less to keep the lights on. Tax reform is helping millions of families with the monthly bills."
"Despite warnings from our Democratic colleagues that tax reform savings would never reach consumers, utilities across America are already making that happen."
Let’s address farmers’ immediate needs. Let’s give them new tools to help secure their future. The farm bill before us is a prime example of the good that can come when we work together. I look forward to the Senate passing it for America’s farm families.
The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s nominee to fill this vacancy. We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall.
I want to express gratitude for the extraordinary service that Justice Kennedy has offered our nation. We owe him a debt of thanks for his ardent defense of the First Amendment right to political speech. #SCOTUS
"The success of tax reform might come as a surprise to the Democrats who opposed it at every turn. But it certainly doesn’t surprise those of us who listened to the American people, and delivered."
"We’ve seen that tax reform is well-suited to the needs of young Americans on the first rungs of the economic ladder, whose employers can now offer more help with continuing education."
"In six short months, we’ve seen that tax reform is well-suited to the needs of the millions of American workers who’ve already pocketed thousand-dollar bonuses to put toward grocery bills and summer camp costs."
"In December, the Democratic Leader said on the Senate floor that there’s nothing about tax reform that’s “suited to the needs of the American worker.” Republicans knew better."
"From top to bottom, this farm bill takes serious steps to ensure the future of American agriculture -- for the sake of our farmers, our rural communities, and the entire country."
"Farm families across America face uncertainty: Natural disasters, from droughts to floods, volatile world markets, and falling commodity prices."
"As the proud senior senator from Kentucky, I know how important the farm bill is to agricultural communities in my home state and around the nation."
My Democratic colleagues are arguing with the facts. They’re arguing with the data. They’re arguing with American families who are keeping more of their own money. They’re arguing with the prosperity our agenda is already helping unleash.
Democrats may want to put Washington’s foot back on the brake by repealing tax reform and piling up more regulations. But they aren’t just arguing with those of us across the aisle.
"And thanks to the leadership of our colleagues at the subcommittee level, more bills will be on their way to the floor for prompt consideration."
"This week, we’ve been considering a regular-order appropriations package and voting on amendments. Thanks to Chairman @SenShelby and Ranking Member @SenatorLeahy for the transparent, bipartisan process that produced this bill."
"Six months later, here’s a remarkable fact: There are now more job openings all across this country than there are Americans looking for work. The optimism and prosperity unleashed by tax reform are part of the reason why."
"Republicans wanted working families to keep more of what they earn and send less to the IRS. Meanwhile, the Democratic Leader in the House said it was “the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.”"
Yesterday marked six months since Congress passed our overhaul of America’s tax code. I remember debating the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act back in December. There were two different philosophies on display.
"I support, and all of the members of the Republican Conference support, a plan that keeps families together while their immigration status is determined."
"Led by Chairman @SenShelby, Ranking Member @SenatorLeahy, and all the subcommittee leadership, the Appropriations committee has engaged in precisely the kind of thorough, considered committee work that ought to define this process."
"The spending agreement reached earlier this year achieved a great deal, but the process wasn’t anybody’s best-case scenario. So here in the Senate, we made it a top bipartisan priority to bring some regular order back into the appropriations process."
"Fortunately, the facts are the facts. Americans know success when they see it. And Republicans will keep fighting to unleash more prosperity for the middle class."
There are more job openings than Americans looking for work for the first time in at least 20 years. But Democrats scoff at falling unemployment. Do they really think an outstanding job market doesn’t matter to American families?
"In #Kentucky, agriculture is part of who we are. Our farm families produce everything from poultry to soybeans. The farm bill that the Agriculture Committee passed yesterday will assist them, encourage economic growth, and increase investment in rural communities."
"Today, on the 243rd birthday of the @USArmy, I’m glad we're voting to continue advancing this critical legislation on behalf of America’s brave men and women in uniform."
"The Armed Services Committee considered and included 300 amendments in the defense bill. On the floor, Chmn @JimInhofe and @SenJackReed included more than 40 more."
"For months, Secretary Mattis and our military leaders have detailed our servicemembers’ most pressing needs and explained the importance of steady resources in the face of evolving threats. We heard them loud and clear – it’s time to put the defense bill across the finish line."
On one side of the aisle are those who mock the good economic news -- those who can’t grasp why an 18-year low in unemployment would matter to American families. On the other side are those of us who helped make it happen.
"Unemployment is lower today than at any time since 2000. Last week, the House Democratic leader responded: “Hip-hip hooray. Unemployment is down. What does that mean to me?”"
I’d like to thank the Chairman & @SenStabenow for working w/ me to include my #HempFarmingAct in the bill. It builds on the success of the pilot program I championed in the 2014 farm bill by removing federal roadblocks to industrial hemp.
"This morning, I’m joining my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee to mark up the farm bill. It’s an impressive piece of legislation, built on bipartisan collaboration and guided by Chairman @SenPatRoberts’ leadership."
"I want to share the Senate’s warmest wishes for a speedy recovery with Larry Kudlow. Larry's a happy warrior for pro-growth, pro-opportunity economics and one of the best guys in Washington. We hope he gets well soon."
"Just hours ago, the American delegation concluded their summit meeting with North Korean officials. I congratulate @POTUS on this major step and share his hope that it will begin a process that leads to an historic peace."
I just got off the phone with my friend @SenatorDole. I was grateful to catch up and thank him for his many years of honorable public service.
It’s one of our most important jobs here in Congress. The 2019 defense authorization is the top item on our to-do list. And we’ll tackle it this week.
"Congress has passed defense authorization acts for 57 consecutive years. In doing so, we’ve taken steps to fulfill one of our most fundamental constitutional responsibilities: authorizing the funds that our men and women in uniform require to keep us safe."
This is part of what we were elected to do: Get Washington D.C.’s foot off the brake. Let hard-working Americans and small businesses spend less time and energy hurdling obstacles put up by the federal government.
"In 2016, under President Obama, the Federal Register printed nearly 39,000 pages of rules (an all-time high) and another 21,000 pages of proposed rules. 60,000 pages to pile on American workers and job creators. In 2017, we slashed those numbers by more than 50 percent."
- Lowest unemployment in 18 yrs.  - More open positions than workers seeking jobs for 1st time on record.  - Optimism among small biz and manufacturers at an all-time high.  - More Americans say now is a good time to find a job than at any time in past 17 yrs.
"Sixteen months ago, @POTUS Trump & GOP majorities arrived in Washington w/ simple instructions from the American people: get the federal government out of our way. Today, under this Republican government, the U.S. economy is healthier than it’s been in a long time."
"The defense bill will support military posts that form the backbone of local communities and advance our National Defense Strategy. Kentuckians are proud of those serving at our state's Army and National Guard installations. When I vote for this defense bill, I'll do it for them."
This isn’t due diligence. It isn’t good government. It’s what happens when our colleagues across the aisle put political slogans about “the resistance” ahead of the country’s needs.
"Not a single Senator voted against confirming Robert Wier or Fernando Rodriguez to serve as district judges yesterday. But Democrats forced us to invoke cloture on each of them, and then made sure they soaked up #Senate floor time, even though literally no Senator opposed them."
"Cloture votes used to be a rare tool of last resort, only used in a tiny handful of cases. Not these days. In many cases, the nominees in question are completely uncontroversial."
"As the #Senate works to give America’s armed forces the resources they need to keep us safe, I’m proud that @POTUS has signed into law our effort to give our veterans the quality care they deserve. #VAMISSIONAct"
"The John S. McCain 2019 National Defense Authorization Act is the result of months of serious, bipartisan work by the Armed Services Committee. And it’s a major step toward delivering the resources our military needs to tackle today's challenges."
"The #Senate has been attacking the #opioid crisis from all angles, but major challenges are rarely solved in Washington. I’m proud of the work of innovators like @USWorldMeds in Louisville to deliver treatments for the millions of Americans affected by opioid addiction."
"Today, the #Senate confirmed Robert Wier to serve on the Eastern District Court of #Kentucky by a vote of 95-0. Despite needless delays, I’m proud that another of @POTUS’ well-qualified nominees is now on the job."
The bipartisan work of the Armed Services Committee has produced a strong NDAA. This legislation sends a clear message that we have our warfighters’ backs.
"After years of spending caps harming the readiness of our military, Congress passed a two-year agreement that included the largest year-on-year increase in funding for our military in 15 years. It’s time to take the next step with the critical National Defense Authorization Act."
Always great to sit down with @BretBaier. Tune in for our conversation this evening on @SpecialReport @FoxNews.
"One bill after another, one confirmation after another, the Senate is producing accomplishments that will directly improve the lives of the American people."
The #Senate is having a productive week:  -Passed VA MISSION Act to keep our promise to our vets -Confirming more of @POTUS’s nominees -Updated how Senate handles claims of harassment -Committees working on annual defense & appropriations bills
"This morning, @POTUS signed a law that will help middle-class families/small businesses access credit. It was the product of hard work by Chairman @MikeCrapo and the Banking Committee, and I was proud to support it."
"Veterans of all eras rely on the promise of accessible, quality care when they return home. But too often, the VA has fallen short of fulfilling it, with long waiting lists and limited treatment options. The shortcomings of the federal bureaucracy were apparent. (1/2)"
"Local lenders and the communities that depend on them needed relief from the inefficient, imprecise, one-size-fits-all regulatory approach of Dodd-Frank. Thanks to Chairman @MikeCrapo and the Banking Committee, that’s just what Congress and @POTUS are poised to deliver."
The bill before us carries the support of @POTUS Trump and 38 veterans advocacy organizations. It’s based on a simple idea: Promises made to those who sacrifice for our freedoms must be promises kept. I’m grateful to @SenatorIsakson for leading the charge to keep this promise.
"Today, the brave men and women of the @CIA welcomed their colleague, Gina Haspel, to a new role for which she is uniquely well-qualified. I am proud the Senate confirmed the right woman for the right moment. Congratulations, Director Haspel."
"The prayers of the entire Senate are with the victims of today’s violence in Santa Fe, their families, and the community that is coming together to support them. We are especially grateful for the first responders and others who work to protect and save lives."
The Senate just confirmed Gina Haspel to lead the @CIA.  Her talent and expertise make her uniquely qualified to face America’s biggest national security challenges.
"According to new survey data from @shopfloorNAM, more than 93% of U.S. manufacturing firms have a positive outlook. Already, 77% of manufacturers are reporting hiring new workers, and 86% say they’re investing in plants and equipment. That's a unified GOP gov't in action. (2/2)"
"Republican policies are shaking the regulatory rust off of the U.S. economy, and American job creators, entrepreneurs, and working families are thinking big again. As we put a stop to the last admin’s top-down federal rulemaking, U.S. manufacturing is churning back to life. (1/2)"
"Last year, under the leadership of @AjitPaiFCC, the agency sought to fix this mistake and restore the rules that helped the internet flourish, while still protecting consumers from abuses. The resolution Democrats put forward today would undo that progress. (2/2)"
"In 2015, President Obama’s FCC set out to fix what wasn’t broken. It imposed regulations designed for Depression-era telephones on new technologies that fit in our pockets. So much for the light-touch approach that helped the early internet grow. (1/2)"
"Even in @SenSchumer’s backyard of Brooklyn, lower excise taxes are letting @nydistilling cut prices. In Kentucky, @CopperAndKings says tax reform is one of the most important initiatives for helping small businesses create jobs. (2/2)"
"After 8 years of Democrats’ policies enriching big cities but leaving small businesses behind, Republican policies are helping workers and job creators thrive all over the country. From Kentucky to Oregon, America’s growing craft distilling industry is a perfect example. (1/2)"
"Gina Haspel is the right woman at the right time. There is no reason why her confirmation should be delayed, and I look forward to advancing it expeditiously."
The amount employers spent on worker pay and benefits grew more in 2017 than in any calendar year under President Obama. This is just the start of what can happen when Republicans get Washington out of the way.
"For years, Democratic policies like high taxes and runaway regulations put a headwind in the faces of American job creators. Now, historic tax reform, regulatory relief, and the rest of our opportunity agenda mean the wind is once again at their backs."
"I also wish to pay tribute today to #Kentucky law enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf. Since #PoliceWeek last year, three of the Commonwealth’s finest have fallen in the line of duty. #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay"
The #Senate welcome @POTUS Trump to the Capitol today.
"We all know John McCain doesn’t exactly have a relaxed bone in his body. He still had plenty to say about work, I assure you.  He misses his colleagues. He misses the Senate. And we sure miss him. (2/2)"
"This weekend, I had the pleasure of traveling to the beautiful hills outside Sedona, Arizona and spending time with John and Cindy McCain on their back porch. I shared my gratitude -- all of our gratitude -- for his service and his sacrifice. (1/2)"
"When @POTUS visits Indiana today, he’ll join Hoosiers to celebrate the new jobs and prosperity that our Republican agenda is delivering to communities across their state, and the entire country."
"After years of failed Democratic policies, America is open for business once again. Surveys show that since @POTUS and Republicans in Congress were elected, three times as many small/indep. employers feel confident in expanding their businesses."
"Overnight, @SecPompeo completed a sensitive diplomatic mission and returned home from North Korea with three freed American prisoners. The families of these three men, and the entire country, are grateful. @StateDept"
"Tight economic sanctions brought the Iranian regime to the table last time, but unfortunately, it led to a hopelessly flawed agreement. @POTUS Trump did the right thing on the Iran agreement.  I think he’ll make a better deal."
Tonight I’ll be on the air in the 6pm hour with @guypbenson and Marie Harf on their new @FoxNewsRadio show @BensonAndHarf.
Looking forward to speaking with @DanaPerino during today’s @DailyBriefing on @FoxNews.
This morning brought welcome news that @POTUS and @SecState had secured the release of 3 Americans. I’m hopeful we can build on this progress and pursue a verifiable agreement to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear arms.
The #Senate is processing six more well-qualified nominees for the federal bench. Each nominee on the slate has been vetted by the Judiciary Committee. And each stands ready to serve as a diligent caretaker of the rule of law. We will keep taking care of the people’s business.
"Gina Haspel is a tremendous choice to lead the Central Intelligence Agency. She would bring more direct, hard-earned experience to the role of @CIA director than any leader in the agency’s history."
"When Democrats controlled Washington, more than 75 percent of manufacturers said an unfavorable business climate from taxes and regulations was a top concern. Now, fewer than 19 percent say that. Republican policies are working."
"In December 2017, after just one year of Republican policies, optimism among American manufacturers hit the highest level ever recorded."
"The percentage of American workers who are unemployed, underemployed, or discouraged recently hit a 17-year low. And the total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits has fallen to a 45-year low."
"Republican policies have taken Washington’s foot off the brake of the U.S. economy. We’ve rolled back a host of job-killing regulations, passed historic tax reform, and helped to unleash a dynamic, job-creating economy."
"This week, the #Senate will consider another slate of extremely well-qualified nominees for seats on the federal bench. A thoughtful, independent, and expert judiciary is a cornerstone of our constitutional order, and I'll be proud to support the first of 6 nominees later today."
I'm looking forward to joining @hughhewitt live on the air at 8:30.
".@SenatorLankford is giving Democrats their own chance to show that principled convictions matter more than political convenience. I'm proud to back his proposal, and glad to see the Rules Committee advance it to the #Senate floor yesterday."
"After the #Senate confirms our 70th Secretary of @StateDept, we will vote on the nomination of Ric Grenell to serve as our Ambassador to Germany."
"Today, the #Senate will confirm Mike Pompeo as our nation’s 70th Secretary of @StateDept on a bipartisan vote, the 2nd time in a little over a year that Mr. Pompeo has been confirmed on a bipartisan vote for one of @POTUS' @Cabinet positions."
"Tonight, 7:00 Eastern  ⬇️ I will be joining @marthamaccallum on @TheStoryFNC to discuss #Senate Democrats' continued historic obstruction of @POTUS' nominees."
The passage of the historic #TaxCutsandJobsAct was just the latest illustration of the diverging paths Republicans and Democrats envision for the U.S. #economy.  #TaxReform is working for the American people.
#ICYMI → the #Senate Foreign Relations Cmte favorably recommended Mike Pompeo to be our nation's 70th Secretary of @StateDept. The Senate will vote to confirm him this week.
"The #Senate will also vote later today to advance the nomination of Kyle Duncan serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who’s legal credentials show @POTUS has made another outstanding choice."
"Today, the Foreign Relations Cmte will consider @POTUS' choice for the next Secretary of @StateDept. It's hard to imagine a better nominee or someone more thoroughly qualified than Mike Pompeo."
"Consumer confidence at a 14 year ⬆️. Jobless claims, a 45 year ⬇️.   #TaxReform is working for the American people and the American #economy."
"This GOP Congress and @POTUS think the Gov needs to give workers and job creators breathing room. So we passed record-setting rollbacks of harmful federal rules that had thrown a wet blanket on the #economy, & enacted sweeping #TaxReform to help families and reignite growth."
".@NASA has been led by an acting administrator for a record 15 months, so I hope all Senators will join me in voting to confirm Jim Bridenstine today."
"The Protecting Moms and Infants Act authorizes increased funding for a competitive federal grant to help organizations address this particular part of the #opioidcrisis, and continues our years-long efforts to protect the most vulnerable."
"Today, I’ll introduce the Protecting Moms and Infants Act, which directs the Secretary of @HHSGov to report on the implementation of the strategies developed in the Protecting Our Infants Act in order to help fight the #opioidcrisis that is plaguing our nation."
"Thanks to @SenToomey & Senator @JerryMoran, the #Senate will be rolling back another piece of Obama-era overreach by nullifying a particularly egregious overstep by his @CFPB and notch another victory in this Congress’s record of rolling back overregulation."
"Barbara Bush wielded her formidable qualities on behalf of her nation, the family she loved, and the many worthy causes she supported. Today a nation joins the Bush family, their many friends, and all the country in their grief, and in prayer."
I will be joining @TeamCavuto at appx 4:00 this afternoon to discuss #TaxDay and how #TaxReform is already benefiting the American people. @FoxNews
"Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct 4,000,000+ Americans (and counting) are receiving special bonuses, pay raises, or new benefits from their employers as a direct result of #TaxReform. #TaxDay"
"ICYMI - yesterday afternoon, I filed cloture on @USCG Authorization Act, a comprehensive package that equips an adaptable force to meet a host of important missions. I hope each Senator will join me in ensuring its passage this week."
"Thanks to @SenToomey and Senator @JerryMoran, we will protect consumers from a brazen attempt by the past director of the @CFPB to stretch his authority and interfere in the auto industry. Now it’s time for the auto industry to come along for the economic tune-up."
"Today I met w/ @POTUS' nominee for Director of the @CIA, Gina Haspel. She has dedicated her professional life to the national security of the United States, and has repeatedly proven to be a consummate intelligence officer and leader. I look forward to supporting her nomination."
"This afternoon, the #Senate will vote to advance legislation from Senator @JerryMoran that would bolster the proper sovereignty of American Indian tribes in the face of excessive federal regulation."
"Over the weekend, America’s all-volunteer armed forces executed a challenging mission with precision and excellence. At @POTUS' order, the US joined w our British & French allies in military action to respond to Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people."
"American entrepreneurs thrive when we scrub the regulatory rust off our #economy and give farmers, ranchers, local communities, community banks, and small businesses more say over their own affairs.  #TaxReform is working for the American people."
"It's time the federal gov changes the way it looks at #hemp, which is why Senator @RonWyden and I, along with @SenJeffMerkley, are introducing legislation that will modernize federal law in this area & empower American farmers to explore this promising new market."
"Andrew Wheeler is ready and waiting... and waiting, thanks to #Senate Dems, to clock in as Deputy Administrator of the @EPA. His qualifications are beyond question. He has won the support of the American @FarmBureau Federation and has won bipartisan praise."
"Despite months of waiting due to Democrats historic obstruction, today the #Senate confirmed Patrick Pizzella, @POTUS' highly qualified nominee to be the Deputy Secretary of @USDOL."
"Today's confirmation of Mr. Ring will give the country a fully-staffed @NLRB once again, and turn the page on the previous administration’s efforts to remake this bipartisan board into a one-sided political weapon."
"Following the confirmation of Ms. Boom to the District Court yesterday, the #Senate has moved to the nomination of John Ring to serve on the @NLRB. After his confirmation today, the Senate will vote on nominees to the @USDOL, the @EPA, and two more District Court vacancies."
"Today, @POTUS signed another piece of bipartisan legislation to help law enforcement and victims with new tools to fight sex trafficking. Thank you to @senrobportman for your continued leadership in furthering #SESTA and helping those caught up in this national epidemic."
"In #Kentucky, @GovMattBevin announced certification of 144 #OpportunityZones. My friends & colleagues on the state & local level are excited & optimistic. This creative policy, along w/ the rest of #TaxReform has the Kentuckians I serve looking forward to a brighter future."
"If yesterday’s vote to advance Claria Horn Boom’s district court nomination were any indication, we’d be in for a productive week. 96 Senators voted in support.   With such bipartisan support, you might think that filing cloture should not have been necessary in the first place."
"The Senate offers our condolences to the families of two former colleagues who have recently passed away, Senator Zell Miller & Senator Daniel Akaka. These committed public servants will be missed."
"This week, the #Senate will work to advance more of @POTUS' highly qualified nominees."
"I know I speak for all Senators in welcoming our new colleague, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. I look forward to working together to continue this Congress’s record of accomplishment for the American people."
"Rebuilding America's #infrastructure is a critical issue that @POTUS, his Administration, and Congress are continuing to work to achieve together."
"At the request of Parkland families, @SpeakerRyan and I ensured the omnibus spending bill will include Senator @JohnCornyn's #FixNICS and @senorrinhatch's STOP School Violence Act."
"Soon, I will be delivering farewell remarks honoring @SenThadChochran's nearly 4 decades of service in the US #Senate."
"It's time to rebuild America's crumbling #infrastructure, and the spending bill will help accomplish just that. It will fund long-overdue improvements to roads, rails, airports and inland waterways, creating #jobs and growing our #economy along the way."
"This spending bill scales up research, treatment and prevention funding and provides grants to first responders to help confront the scourge of the #OpioidEpidemic head-on and help save lives. For rural communities, like many in #Kentucky, this is a big deal."
"The House will vote soon on a landmark appropriations bill for the remainder of FY 2018, after which we will take it up here in the #Senate. The is legislation that neither side sees as perfect, but which contains significant victories and achievements for the American people."
"From coal country to farming communities & everywhere in between, Obama-era over regulation was holding our #economy back. Opportunity zones offer a chance for real relief. #Kentucky officials say they may designate 144 new zones, prioritizing growth in areas that need it most."
"The best way to breathe new life into struggling communities is not to invent a new federal program, it’s to make those communities attractive places to do business, open new facilities, and create good-paying jobs. That's exactly what #TaxReform does."
"The approps package is being finalized and it will contain: largest year-on-year increase in funding for @DeptofDefense in 15 yrs, major steps forward for law enforcement and border security, for the fight against #OpioidEpidemic, for our #Veterans, and many other priorities."
"This week the #Senate will take up a spending bill that will meet a number of the nation’s most pressing challenges and mark the end of disproportionate and harmful cuts to @DeptofDefense funding, and deliver the largest increase in defense spending in 15 years."
"Thank you @senrobportman for your hard work on advancing anti-sex-trafficking legislation. This afternoon, the #Senate will vote on #SESTA and I urge all Senators to support it."
"In addition to rebuilding our #infrastructure, helping stop the #OpioidEpidemic, and giving our men and women in uniform a well-deserved pay raise, the spending bill means increased oversight and modernization in the @DeptVetAffairs for our veterans here at home."
"After years of disproportionate cuts to our armed services, Congress has begun to provide adequate resources and put an end to the harmful decline in combat readiness. For our men and women in uniform, including those in #Kentucky, this means a well-deserved pay raise."
"Later this week, the #Senate will consider an omnibus spending bill to address a number of critical priorities, from rebuilding America's #infrastructure to fighting the #OpioidEpidemic, and delivering the resources and certainty that America’s military deserves."
.@senrobportman's #SESTA bill will close a loophole in existing law that allows websites to avoid responsibility even as they knowingly facilitate trafficking.
I will oppose the #Yemen resolution on both policy and procedural grounds. Our support to our allies in Yemen does not involve placing US forces in active warfare or hostilities.
"#SESTA will ensure websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking can be held accountable for facilitating these heinous crimes. @senrobportman has worked long and hard on this subject, and he has helped assemble a broad, bipartisan coalition."
"Ensuring our national security means steady control over what, and who, comes across our borders. I urge everyone to join me in voting to confirm Mr. McAleenan to lead @CBP later today."
"This week, the #Senate will take up an omnibus spending bill that builds on the bipartisan funding agreement reached in Feb. It will provide our military w the stable funding they need to meet emerging challenges & also strengthen our fight against the scourge of opioid addiction"
"The philosophy for more school choice, championed by @SenTedCruz in the historic #TaxReform bill is simple: More choice is better than less. Parents know best what works for their children."
"Our children should not be sold, online or anywhere else. The bill the #Senate will consider would ensure that institutions that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking can be held accountable for their actions. That's why 67 Senators have joined @senrobportman in support. #SESTA"
"Now that the #Senate has passed #Relief4MainStreet, we will focus on legislation to combat sex trafficking, a crisis right here in the United States. #SESTA"
"#ICYMI ➡️ Yesterday, on a strong bipartisan vote, the #Senate passed Sen @MikeCrapo’s #Relief4MainStreet bill to streamline Dodd-Frank so that regulations intended for Wall Street place less of a crushing burden on Main Street."
"Yesterday, the #Senate advanced @POTUS' nomination of Kevin McAleenan to serve as Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, @CBP. This is an essential post and he is an excellent nominee. I urge everyone to join me in voting for his confirmation on Monday."
".@POTUS' pick for National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, is a warrior for pro-growth economics, and widely respected for his expertise in fiscal policy. I look forward to continued engagement with the White House team that will benefit from his insight."
"Because of #TaxReform, including the family-leave incentive championed by @SenatorFischer, huge national employers such as @Starbucks and @CVSHealth are expanding paid family leave programs or creating new ones."
"Today, @POTUS will be visiting @Boeing and witnessing first-hand how #TaxReform is working for the people of #Missouri, despite every single Democrat voting against bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits for the American people."
"Dodd-Frank was created for Wall Street, but it's crushing Main Street. Sen @MikeCrapo's #Relief4MainStreet bill will pass soon, streamlining regulations so smaller lenders aren’t caught up in the web of regulations just makes sense."
"Today, @SenateCommerce will continue their hearings on rebuilding our infrastructure. Secretaries of @USDOL @CommerceGov @ENERGY @USDA & @USDOT will all share the administration’s ideas for cutting red tape, streamlining permitting, and aligning federal resources with local needs"
"With every favorable #TaxReform story, Democrats tie themselves in knots trying to convince everyone that new investments, new jobs, new raises and bonuses, are somehow not good news after all. They say it’s nothing more than “crumbs.”"
"Later today, the #Senate will vote to advance the financial reform bill.  Senator @MikeCrapo’s legislation starts from a simple premise: Small community lenders on Main Street are not the same as the multi-trillion-dollar banks on Wall Street. #Relief4MainStreet"
"Thanks to Sen @MikeCrapo, Ds & Rs have joined together to cosponsor a bill that would streamline obstacles tripping up smaller institutions. It’s a commonsense, compromise measure, and we don't need to resolve all of our differences on Dodd-Frank in order to unite behind it."
"7.5 years later, Dodd-Frank has proved to be too blunt of an instrument. It’s imposed a crushing regulatory burden on small community banks and credit unions. #Relief4MainStreet"
"Rather than fixing “too big to fail,” Dodd-Frank has threatened to make Main Street community banks and credit unions “too small to succeed.” #Relief4MainStreet"
"Every day, we hear about how bonuses, rising wages, expanded benefits and lower taxes are giving middle-class families a lot more breathing room. But every day, we are reminded how every single Democrat voted against more money for the American people."
Happening now - @VP is in #Kentucky speaking with small business owners and community leaders about the impact #TaxReform is having on them.
"Dodd-Frank’s inefficient, one-size-fits-all framework dropped small banks & credit unions into the regulatory maze that was intended for Wall Street. For 8 yrs, they’ve faced a staggering compliance burden that now consumes, on average, 24% of their net income. #Relief4MainStreet"
"77% of agricultural loans come from community banks. These banks play a pivotal role in rural areas and farming communities, like those in #Kentucky. #Relief4MainStreet"
"A majority of small-business loans are handled by community banks. Community banks, credit unions, and other small-scale lenders play a vital role in the U.S. #economy. #Relief4MainStreet"
"Today, the Senate will vote to take up Sen. @MikeCrapo’s Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. This bill recognizes a simple truth: Small community banks and main-street credit unions are not the same as the multi-trillion-dollar banks on Wall Street."
"The Senate’s loss is @SenThadCochran’s family’s gain. As we say our farewells over the next few weeks, I know all of our colleagues will join me in wishing him health and every happiness as he sets out on his next chapter."
"Yesterday, the Senate learned that its “quiet persuader” will be leaving us after a long and distinguished career. @SenThadCochran’s retirement will mark the end of a tenure defined by steady, honorable leadership."
"The United States has finally taken a long-overdue step and recognized that Israel’s true capital is Jerusalem. Jerusalem is where the United States embassy belongs. And in just a few months, for the first time ever, that’s exactly where it will be. #AIPAC2018"
"Fortunately, in the last year, a new administration and a united front in Congress have charted a new course. America is rebuilding our capabilities, our partnerships, and our will to do what the circumstances require. #AIPAC2018"
"All these failures stemmed from a central misunderstanding: For eight years, the previous administration failed to recognize that the U.S. and Israel are stronger together, and that we share a commonality of interests. #AIPAC2018"
"The Obama administration’s fealty to the nuclear deal spawned a reluctance to address Iran’s regional ambitions. And Iran was happy to exploit that void, menacing our ships and planes deployed to the Persian Gulf. #AIPAC2018"
I’ll be speaking shortly at #AIPAC2018 on the importance of the US-Israel partnership.
"Today, the #Senate will vote on 2 more of @POTUS' talented federal district judge nominees: Karen Scholer for the Northern District of Texas and Tilman Self for the Middle District of Georgia."
"Because Congress passed #TaxReform & @POTUS signed it into law, workers and small biz owners across our nation are already reaping the benefits. But remember, every single Democrat voted to block the #TaxCutsandJobsAct & stop Americans from keeping more of their hard earned money"
"To Lie in Honor is a very rare tribute, even rarer for an American w/o Gov or military service. But it perfectly suits Billy Graham, whose preaching inspired hundreds of millions worldwide, who counseled presidents, and whom an entire nation came to know as “America’s pastor.”"
"The #Senate just confirmed Elizabeth Branch to the 11th Circuit, the 14th circuit court judge that @POTUS has placed into a lifetime appointment. Together, we are working to put judges on the bench that uphold the rule of law."
Let’s continue our constitutional responsibility & confirm @POTUS' outstanding judicial nominees. It's a further credit to the outstanding work of Chairman @ChuckGrassley & the @senjudiciary committee.
Democrats like to speak about the importance of paid leave. But not a single one of them voted in favor of #TaxReform.  Every single Democrat in the House and #Senate voted against the bill that included @SenatorFischer’s paid family leave incentives.
"Thanks to the tireless work of @SenatorFischer, the #TaxCutsandJobsAct encourages more employers to provide paid family leave. That's good news for nearly 4 Million American families that will welcome a child this year.  #TaxReform is working for the American people."
"Several senators, led by Senator @ChuckGrassley, have crafted legislation that accommodates the major interests of all sides. It fulfills the stated goal of Democrats AND conforms to the @POTUS' requirements for #Immigration & #DACA."
"Because of #TaxReform, when a couple starts a family, they’ll benefit from the fact that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct doubled the child tax credit, thanks to the work of @SenDeanHeller throughout the committee process."
#Senate Democrats say they want resolution for illegal immigrants who were brought to this country as children. @POTUS' framework would do just that and more by offering a more than generous resolution to 1.8 million such individuals.
"This entire week has been set aside, as I assured it would be, for votes on #DACA, border security, and other #immigration issues. We should be wrapping up a week of debate, amendments, & numerous votes. Instead, we have yet to vote on a single amendment."
"In addition to @POTUS calling for the nation's flags to be flown at half-staff, the #Senate will hold a moment of silence at Noon to honor the victims in Parkland, Florida."
"Schools should be places where children can learn, and faculty and staff can work, without fear of violence. My colleagues from Florida will carry home the prayers of the whole Senate, for victims and their families, for the community of Parkland, and for the first responders."
"I'm deeply saddened by the horrific violence in Florida. Praying for the victims, their families, and the Parkland community. Always grateful for first responders who charge into harm’s way."
"We must streamline regulations, reform the permitting process, and get government out of the way wherever possible. I’m grateful @POTUS is prioritizing this and reaching across the aisle to fix our failing #Infrastructure."
"Keeping Americans safe does not need to be a partisan issue & addressing important safety issues along w #DACA, border security, and other parts of our broken immigration system is our best chance to produce legislation that can pass the House, #Senate, and earn @POTUS' signature"
.@POTUS' #DACA framework is a compassionate resolution for the illegal immigrants who were brought to this country as children. It offers a generous solution for those 1.8 million that goes well beyond what many anticipated he would offer.
"Day after day, the headlines show more bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits as a direct result of #TaxReform. National employers like @pfizer & @HomeDepot, which employ more than half a million Americans, have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in employee bonuses."
"The #TaxCutsandJobsAct will directly help families by cutting tax rates. In every paycheck, American workers will keep more of what they earn.  #TaxReform is working for the American people."
"If other #immigration proposals are to be considered, Senators will have to introduce their own amendments, rather than just talk about them. I made a commitment to hold this debate this week. I've lived up to my commitment. I hope this opportunity does not go to waste."
"Yesterday, several of my colleagues announced an #immigration compromise that I believe is our best chance to make law. It gives a compassionate solution for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought to the US as children. And it delivers on @POTUS' stated conditions."
"This week, I urge all Senators to look past making political points on #immigration and #DACA, and focus on making actual law."
"For a month now, I’ve repeatedly said I’d bring #immigration to the #Senate floor following a government funding agreement. Senators have had plenty of time to prepare. There is no reason why we should not reach a bipartisan solution this week."
"Due to the heavy rainfall over the weekend, #Kentucky residents are enduring widespread flooding in several Southeastern counties. My staff in Eastern Kentucky is working closely with local officials in the community, and I am monitoring the situation and receiving updates."
"I hope the #Senate can seize this opportunity and deliver real progress towards securing our border, reforming aspects of our immigration policy, and achieving a resolution for individuals who were brought to our country illegally when they were young."
The Secure and Succeed Act is our best chance of producing a solution that can actually resolve the immigration issue. We need a bill that can pass the #Senate and pass the House and earn @POTUS' signature.
I appreciate @POTUS' focus on improving America's infrastructure. His proposal to eliminate regulatory barriers and streamline lengthy and over-complicated permitting processes makes sense.
"For the families who are still struggling to rebuild in the wake of last year's spate of natural disasters, this budget agreement will provide funds for more relief."
"In addition to helping our military, #Veterans, and with disaster relief, this budget agreement invests in the future of our nation's infrastructure, a shared bipartisan priority."
"On average, the #opioidcrisis takes more than 100 American lives every day. This budget agreement provides an additional $6 billion in additional funding for new grants, prevention programs, and law enforcement initiatives to bolster existing national and state efforts."
Short-term funding bills have handicapped our military's ability to engage in long-term planning and investment. This budget agreement will give our men and women in uniform the resources they need.
"After years of broken promises to our #Veterans, we are helping reform the @DeptVetAffairs by passing legislation to give our heroes more accessible care, choice, and workforce training they deserve."
"This bill represents a significant, bipartisan step forward. I urge every Senator to review this legislation and join in voting to advance it."
"Too often, underfunded, over-complicated bureaucracies fail to deliver the care our #Veterans deserve. This bill will provide for our returning heroes."
"As I’ve said publicly many times, our upcoming immigration debate on #DACA, border security, & other issues will be a process that is fair to all sides. While I obviously cannot guarantee any outcomes, let alone supermajority support, I can ensure the process is fair to all sides"
"The bipartisan budget agreement will fund new grants, prevention programs, and law enforcement efforts in vulnerable communities across the country struggling against the #opioidcrisis and substance abuse."
"In addition to helping our military and #Veterans, this bipartisan agreement will provides funding for disaster relief efforts. Last year, powerful storms crippled #PuertoRico & #USVI and damaged communities from #Florida to #Texas, this bill will get more help on the way."
"First and foremost, this bipartisan agreement will unwind the sequestration cuts that have hurt our military and jeopardized national security. As @DeptofDefense Secretary Mattis said, “no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than sequestration.”"
"For the first time in years, our military will have the resources needed to keep us safe. This funding will help serve #Veterans who have bravely served, & it will ensure efforts such as disaster relief, infrastructure, and build on our fight against opioid abuse & drug addiction"
"I'm happy to announce that our bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on defense spending and other priorities have yielded a significant agreement. Thank you @SenSchumer for joining me this afternoon, and for the productive discussions that generated this proposal."
"This Congress is determined to reignite an #economy that works for everyone. That’s why #TaxReform lets families across the US keep more of what they earn, and makes America a more attractive place to create #jobs and gives our businesses a fairer fight with foreign competitors."
"Take-home pay is going up, and families everywhere are keeping more of their own hard-earned money. This is great news for middle class Americans.  So why are Democrats afraid to acknowledge that #TaxReform is working?"
"Families in #Kentucky don't call a permanent raise or a multi-thousand-dollar bonus “#crumbs”. Thanks to #TaxReform, paying the bills has already gotten a little less painful for millions of families. Planning for the future has gotten a little easier."
"Already, millions of American workers have received a #TaxReform bonus, pay increase, or other benefits, but apparently a $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000 bonus isn’t much to my colleagues from New York or San Francisco."
".@SenatorTimScott's ""opportunity zones"" will empower communities that have been passed over time and time again to, in effect, put up big neon signs that say “We’re open for business.” It will help struggling communities reach their full potential. All thanks to #TaxReform. #IIOA"
".@SenatorTimScott made sure that #TaxReform included a provision to create “opportunity zones” across the US, allowing governors to designate economically-distressed areas for special tax incentives that will make them more attractive places to invest and create #jobs. #IIOA"
"Senators on both sides of the aisle say they agree that our warfighters deserve sufficient, stable funding to fulfill the missions and tasks their country assigns them.  Today, each of us will have the chance to back up that sentiment with our vote."
"#ICYMI - @UPS, @Lowes, @Amgen, and others are investing more, expanding more, hiring more American workers, and giving bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits to their employees thanks to #TaxReform found in the #TaxCutsandJobsAct."
"I’ve recently heard many Dems detail the harmful effects of short-term funding measures on our servicemembers. Soon, everyone will have the chance to vote to give them the certainty they deserve while our other work continues."
There’s no reason why our warfighters need to continue to face uncertainty until spending issues are resolved. @DeptofDefense Secretary Mattis has repeatedly pointed out that short-term continuing resolutions harm the readiness of our forces.
".@POTUS and Republicans in Congress understand that when you make America a more attractive place to invest and create #jobs, you are helping American families and communities. That’s why we seized on the opportunity to provide #TaxReform with the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. #SOTU"
