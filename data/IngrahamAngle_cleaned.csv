"Most foreign affairs “journalists” are happiest with a US president in total capitulation to Europe—Iran Deal, climate change treaty, subservience to China.  So of course they claim the G-7 was a flop!"
Revealing to hear @Acosta of @CNN giving more credence to PRC about ongoing trade negotiations than to President Trump. #CommunistChina
Great news that Durable goods up above projections...the fundamentals of the US economy are solid as the Fed Chair said last week.
“I’m aghast that some people trust the PRC more than they do the White House.” —@jimcramer @CNBC #China @realDonaldTrump
"I truly don’t understand the point of any political movement that tries to help China.  Xi’s plans are bad for all Americans, whether you are on the left or right.  Goodnight."
"How about we gradually de-couple from China and say: “We’ll start reengaging when the trade cheating ends, the Dalai Lama is welcomed back, the Uighers & Christians aren’t oppressed, and political dissidents released.” #IngrahamAngle @FoxNews"
"Anyone concerned about trade and the economy shd be urging Congress to pass the #USMCA--which will spur U.S.  job growth.  And an infrastructure bill. Meanwhile, Sleepy Joe pushes a tax INCREASE."
"Politicians who work to persuade and listen to Americans who disagree can create movements that outlive them.  Trump needs to move into that mode.  With Dems marinating in pessimism, he wins as the tough but happy warrior."

"China oppresses Uighers, Christians, all ethnic minorities, women, gays and political dissidents.  They’re cracking down brutally on Hong Kong. Why are we propping them up, empowering them again?"
Before the stand off we sent about $160 billion in US exports to China.  They sent $500 billion worth of goods here.  Do the math—we have a $20 trillion economy.  Not a big hit to us. Big for them.
The @nytimes is predictable and tired.  Banning speech is their answer to most problems these days—demonizing and dividing when healing and unity are in order.
"Prediction: using the El Paso horror as justification, Dems will try to prevent @realDonaldTrump from campaigning across America.  The language some use to describe him merely escalates hatred and fear."
"If all we need is the “right president” as was said this morning, then why did we have mass shootings under Obama?"
Attempts to blame President Trump for shooting: @CNN host asks @SenSanders if he thinks @realDonaldTrump is a white supremacist.  Sanders says yes.
"Senseless killing, pure evil came to the beautiful city of El Paso today.  Prayers for all the victims and their families.  Thanks to law enforcement and first responders for their heroic efforts."

"Hey @JulianCastro, if you were the HUD Secretary when Flint happened, doesn’t that prove that you aren’t the best person to address that issue?"
"Being Loony Left Means Never Having to Think it Through: What if other countries, like China, refuse to lower their greenhouse gas emissions?  What’s the actual plan here?"
"No one, including Dems on that stage, believe that any of these candidates will get further on health care than Obama did."
It’s important that Biden said he’ll go back into the Paris Climate Accord.  The GOP will remind folks about that. Opening for Trump.
"Again, can’t we assume that if Democrats knew how to fix Baltimore, they would have already fixed it?"
The question from @cnn should be:  why will you be better than Obama was at addressing racial divisions?
I like @AndrewYang.  But I keep thinking he’ll be replaced by a robot on stage soon.
"Can’t we assume that if the Democrats knew how to fix the public schools, they would have fixed them by now?"
I look forward to the 2020 Dems having a debate over how to fix the metropolitan school systems that are run almost entirely by Democrats.
And @KamalaHarris repeatedly asserts that claims she disagrees with are “not true.”  Is someone fact-checking her?
Wait.  Now Biden is a bad guy for not working against Barack Obama during his two terms in office?
America has been yearning for a long debate over Southern senators from the 1970’s.
We are now debating the 1970s and 1980s.  #LosingAmerica
Has any candidate beside Biden said anything nice about Obama?
Now we’ve moved from the Newark P.D. to the NYPD.  How many of you agree with these candidates that the police in those cities are dangerous to the public?
Well Trump has the law enforcement vote locked up tonight. All being demonized by the Dems.
Is @KamalaHarris even at this debate?
Castro wants to end qualified immunity for police???  Wacko doesn’t realize we already have a massive shortage in police in major U.S. cities.
Now it’s all about federalizing local police! #SoFarLeftTheyLeftAmerica
Are we really having a debate over the history of the Newark police department?
So on the one hand we are all doomed because of climate change.  On the other we should welcome literally every potential immigrant in the world.
"I don’t understand why the open borders crowd talks about immigration reform.  They don’t need any new laws — once you’re here, you’re here."
Jay Inslee is detestable.  How courageous to attack Trump instead of answer a question.
"So now Biden is saying Obama was too harsh on deportations! Answered “no” when asked if he’d keep up Obama’s pace of 800,000 deportations."
And @MichaelBennet is like the one guy in your study group who keeps reminding everyone that they need to get ready for finals.  Almost feel sorry for him.  But he didn’t have to be a Democrat.
So Castro just admitted that he’s for open borders.  Decriminalizing border crossings + Marshall Plan for Central America...that’ll work!

This is a really substantive debate and important Qs asked.  Only horrid bias was from Lemon but we expected that.  @jaketapper & @DanaBashCNN both handled topics well.
Yes @RepTimRyan would be great in Trump’s Cabinet!
"Here’s an idea.  Have California pay reparations.  They should be able to pass it out there, right? Then New York and every other Dem state.  They have the power to pay now—so just do it."
Pablum and pandering.  No one with real world experience on that stage other than @JohnDelaney.
"Universal college will eliminate racism?  How? And the logical follow up to all of this is—if it’s so smart, why didn’t Obama do it?"
Asking @BetoORourke a question is like throwing the ball to that kid in P.E. who always drops it.
Dems haven’t explained how we make energy a lot more expensive and still give everyone a better life?
"It’s official: @SenSanders, like @ewarren, is not very interested in freedom.  Americans aren’t giving up their cars, their guns or their employer-provided insurance."
I’m happy with having a presidential election about whether the oil industry should be outlawed.
More @marwilliamson please! Trump should and could get some of the “back to earth” and “natural food” crowd.  Subsidies to farmers part of problem.
Remind me.  Whom did @ewarren put in jail from the “big banks” again?
Rep. Tim Ryan is making the obvious point—good for him—dangling freebies won’t win the election.
Watching the #DemDebate... most sound like they think they’re running to be Prime Minister of Sweden.  There’s little recognition of what the U.S. is actually like.
John Delany is the smartest person on that #DemDebate stage by miles and miles.  He ran significant businesses—Medicare already doesn’t cover doctors’ costs.  Medicare for All tanks entire system.
Mexico and Guatemala are now doing more to support enforcement of US immigration law than the Democrats.

"The bottom line is that either @paulkrugman doesn’t know what he’s talking about, or he’s hiding the facts.  Either way, he shouldn’t be writing columns on trade for the @nytimes."
"4.  He ignores fact that mfging jobs and wages are both growing faster than they did before @realDonaldTrump took office.  5.  He ignores the fact that we have the strongest economy of any G-7 country, and June jobs number—224,000—BOOM!"
2.  He ignores the concessions that South Korea made to keep their trade deal.  3.  He ignores the fact that China agreed to come back to the table even after we raised tariffs in May.
"When open borders leftists like @JoaquinCastrotx run out of ideas, they run to reflexive racial defamation, w/ a dash of misogyny.  They caused this border crisis—and no amount of gaslighting, emotional photo ops or slander will exonerate them."
Heard @mercedesschlapp leaving the WH to help with campaign among other things. She was a huge asset to @realDonaldTrump — a great talent and human being!
"Democrats use illegal immigrants as political pawns & props, without regard to how the current system enriches cartels, endangers women & children, and hurts working class Americans."
No masks should allowed to cover faces and hide identities at ANY protestors.  It’s a security issue.  Are the Antifa Marxist slime afraid to lose their barista jobs? Or upset mommy & daddy? #cowards
"Liberals once believed that it was a sign of strength for a president to go to extraordinary lengths for peace. President Trump did this today in North Korea.  Historic, regardless of the outcome."
Antifa is a terrorist organization. When will the Trump Admin label it as such? Americans who chronicle their behavior are being savagely beaten in the streets. @MrAndyNgo
"Kamala Harris executed a planned, fully choreographed hit on an already vulnerable and doddering Biden. When it got more complex—eliminating private insurance (“oh, I didn’t mean that!”)—she flipped and flopped."
The Obamas won again. Kamala was always their choice.  She filleted Biden.
Chief Justice John Roberts should quit and run for office.  He’s obviously more interested in policy and being liked than upholding the Constitution.

"Democrats know that if they can demoralize @realdonaldTrump's base on immigration, they improve their chances in 2020. The recent deportation pause or backtrack emboldened Pelosi & Co and incentivizes more illegal crossings."
"Wall or no wall, because of ONE Obama judge’s ruling, we are on track to have more than a million caught & released at our Southern border this year...never to be deported? even when a court orders it.  Can’t have bad headlines...to heck with American citizens."
"An alliance between radical open-borders non-profits like @RAICESTEXAS with Dems & the media, and ONE federal judge in California, has created the current crisis. Lies & distortions abound. The goal: ZERO detentions, ZERO deportations. Ever."

"For the record the quote from my podcast “we won, you lost, that’s that” was referencing the general world map that changed over millennia due to war—and we discussed how coming together as one people of all races would be best path forward."
"The leftists at the @thedailybeast and the Soros-Funded Media Matters have zero credibility— slapping misleading headlines on “stories” to malign, defame & misrepresent, to silence speech."

"Hey @JoeBiden, America sees where China appeasement got us. And we’re not going back."
If anyone should step down it’s @SpeakerPelosi who can’t run her circus...I mean caucus...and who has ZERO to show for her first 100 days back in power. #BarrTooHigh
It’s time to press pro-China @JoeBiden and @HillaryClinton on how much $ their families made in China or with China-related interests.
"In @SecPompeo America has an adult who sees the world (incl China) as it is.  China longs for the day to have pushovers Rice, Powers & Kerry back in at State."
"“Unbelievable ignorance,” said @SecPompeo on @IlhanMN’s comments blaming the U.S. for Venezuela’s unrest. #IngrahamAngle"
"Facts not Opinions: The Obama DOJ was taking cues from FusionGPS, which was being paid by @HillaryClinton, then they set-up Papadopolous in London, as the DNC tried to get dirt on Trump from Ukraine. And Barr’s the problem?"

"ALREADY SPINNING TRUMP RE-ELECTION: @HillaryClinton just blamed her loss on Russia, and warned other 2020 candidates they can’t win until that is fixed."
Loved @TuckerCarlson’s segment with @BretEastonEllis tonight and @hannity’s with @KarlRove & @HawleyMO abt the pathetic  preening by Dems at Barr Hearing. #realfacts #truthagenda
"So let me get this straight, Dems’ contention is that Barr decided to misrepresent Mueller’s findings, knowing full well he was releasing the entire 448-page report in a few wks anyway?"
"What Mueller's crew was likely most upset about wasn't Barr's synopsis, but the fact that they found no collusion with Russia and didn't have the stones to fight in court for a @realDonaldTrump sit-down."
"Understand this: today was as much about 2020 preening, auditioning as anything else. Take the cameras out of there, and half of them probably wouldn't have shown up. @SenAmyKlobuchar @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris"
Loved @KamalaHarris hitting Barr for not reading the million+ docs already read by Mueller team--Barr and Rosenstein accepted Mueller's findings and conclusions and sent them to Congress. The right thing to do.
"Hawaii should ask that Senator @maziehirono return her salary, with interest.  She's embarrassed herself and the state today with her unhinged, disrespectful ranting."
"Taxpayers should demand these Trump-hating, Barr bashing Democrats repay their salaries.  This Barr hearing is a complete & total farce."
"As the #BarrHearing gets underway, can the Dems shake their Mueller addiction? Email your name and number to ingraham.podcast@gmail.com so we can hear your thoughts on today's podcast."
"Dems flailed and failed on Trump-Russia collusion.  So to satisfy their base, they’ve moved on to Barr-Trump collusion.  Lame."
Do these people understand the the Special Counsel works for the DOJ and that the DOJ is headed by Barr? Mueller thus reports to Barr.  Period.  #Govt101
"Not only did AG Barr have NO obligation to release the full report, he was under NO obligation to produce a brief synopsis.  He did both for transparency’s sake and is being crucified for it."
Coming up on #IngrahamPodcast—searing FACTUAL analysis of the #Barr hearings and young  voters for @realDonaldTrump w/ new podcaster @charliekirk11!

"Fire the speechwriter, @JoeBiden. And he's desperately trying to punch out lines loudly, which just ends up sounding strained."
"Oh my God, if this is really the best @JoeBiden can do, the Democrats are in trouble.  It all seems tired and out of sync with the reality of this economy, esp wages & unemployment numbers. Dangling freebies to whoops and hollers. Hardly original."
"Joe Biden says we need to bring back the ""dignity of work."" Is he actually arguing that after 8 yrs under Obama, and only two under Trump, suddenly ""dignity of work"" has been destroyed? Wages are going UP, Joe!"
"This @JoeBiden speech is...just...sad.  ""All of America has to be rebuilt."" WHAT?!"
"At his first rally, Joe Biden says ""it's time to redefine what a successful economy looks like."" How convenient now that the economy, by even the measures the Obama Administration used, is ON FIRE. #GoalPostsShifting #Uninspired"
Watching @RaymondArroyo hosting the #IngrahamAngle...tune in. @FoxNews ... tmrw too!
"“China’s investments in the EU have seen a significant surge over the past decade. Nearly 9.5 percent of the bloc’s foreign-owned firms have their ownership based in China, Hong Kong, and Macau, up from 2.5 percent in 2007.”"

"My colleague @Judgenap just said the Congress “should” make “the most out of” Mueller’s findings on obstruction. Two years and $30M, started by phony dossier...entire thing was tainted...and so are the Dems  crying foul."
"But is Hillary & Co. transparent & forthcoming when investigated?  If destroying thousands of emails & smashing Blackberry devices is transparency, YES!"
"Mueller’s team didn’t have the stomach to try to wage a legal fight over subpoenaing the President.  If they thought @realDonaldTrump was a criminal, they would have fought for a face-to-face."
Anyone on any network who is claiming that AG Bill Barr was acting in any way unethically here has zero credibility on ANY legal or political matters. #NeverTrumpFrauds
"The media who pretend to have veneer of objectivity, trashing one of the most experienced and respected legal thinkers in America, reveal themselves once again."
"Non lawyers with ZERO understanding of the underlying legal requirements, spouting IDIOCY.  The AG recounted what’s in the report and they trash him.  Mueller works for the DOJ, goofballs, not the other way around."
“This was a political speech endorsing the president’s behavior (by Barr).” — @JeffreyToobin @CNN Beyond absurd and desperate.
"Barr wasn’t legally required to do this—press statement, summary or give full report to Congress.  He did it anyway for transparency—and yet the jackals still not satisfied.  Media’s a total joke."
Bill Barr is exactly the man we need at the moment. No emotion.  No spin.  No hyperbole.  A study in contrast with today’s “objective” media.

Coming up @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows on the new Barr “FISA” team and more!
Obama downplayed his enforcement of immigration laws and deportations.  Trump embraces his obligation and is crucified for it. Many in media incredibly dishonest or lazy in reporting.
"As time went on, the Obama Admin just buckled, was overwhelmed by sheer volume of border crossers and gave up. Hence catch & release became norm. And here we are today."
Judge Dolly Gee ruled Obama was violating a 20yr case (Flores) by holding families longer than 20 days.  (Absurd!)
Obama initially built family detention facilities in Texas and New Mexico holding thousands and sent others to small 100-bed facility in Pennsylvania.
"Under Obama, heads of households were deported when child’s welfare was jeopardized, same happens today.  Then and now, deportees given option to take minor children with them, incl those born here. Some do not take children then complain abt separation."
Obama violated his own words thst US couldn’t allow illegal immigrants to just pour across border and that most would need to go back.
"The Obama Admin’s eventual answer to huge spike in UACs & family units? Across the board catch & release. This in turn triggered a BIGGER crisis.  Bring a child, you’re in."
Even Canada today announced it will now deny asylum seekers who either didn’t apply in the US or were denied here.  Are they a bunch of racists too?
"Blaming climate change for the crush at our border is Dems’ way of absolving themselves from responsibility for enriching cartels, human traffickers and smugglers."
"The fault for one of the worst migration crises in human history lies with those who could have closed the loopholes, changed the law, and didn’t...Congress."

Earth to @CNN and @msnbc: Mueller decided NO FURTHER investigation on obstruction was warranted—a decision made on the merits.  DOJ agreed. That means @potus was FULLY exonerated..
It’s Lent but it feels like Christmas.  Avenatti charged.  Trump cleared.
So Trump is cleared and former @cnn media darling and Trump basher @MichaelAvenatti was just charged with “extortion” in New York against @Nike.
Rate your faith in the media now that the Mueller Investigarion is finished?
It is imperative that the DOJ doesn’t let this go.  Hoaxes must not come and go without consequences. #RussiaHoax

Uproariously hilarious to see @Morning_Joe contort themselves to find fault in Trump’s #SOTU2019 — another sign he connected with America.
"What did you think of last night's #SOTU? Email your name and number to ingraham.podcast@gmail.com, and you can be on today's podcast!"
"Results versus resistance and revenge.  The American people are fair-minded, which is why those who watched overwhelmingly liked it."
HILARIOUS moment when @CNN had to report results of its own instant poll—59% had “very positive” reaction to speech; 17% “somewhat positive.” #winning @realDonaldTrump
Dem women sitting on hands embarrassed themselves tonight—esp @SpeakerPelosi who often appeared to be doing the Crossword as @realDonaldTrump was speaking.
"No Republican has done better since Reagan bringing to light the gallantry and humility of American heroes, with a focus on healing the homefront.  #SOTU2019"
The #GhostGals won’t even applaud the jobs numbers from Friday! Apparently prefer more Americans out of the workplace.
Love how the ladies in white don’t clap for record low unemployment for African Americans!  #SurrenderSquad
"Talk to me on today’s podcast: email Ingraham.podcast@gmail.com w/ name, phone #. Northam, SOTU, and “All aspects of Trump’s adult life” being investigated by SDNY."
"Class and enduring talent without gimmicks.  Thank you, @MsGladysKnight. The stadium loved you. #MidnightTraintoGeorgia"
FACT: Dominion Power does NOT want Lt Gov Justin Fairfax to take over the governorship from @RalphNortham bc Fairfax is opposed to their multi-billion gas pipeline.
"Tonight a LIVE #IngrahamAngle on the @RalphNortham KKK double standard, @Kaepernick7 crashing the Super Bowl, and #FakeNews exposed again."
Ed Gillespie should get a full refund from whosever ran his oppo research operation.  @RalphNortham
"Judge Amy Berman Jackson, Obama appointee, is mulling a gag order that wd harm @StoneColdRoger’s ability to raise $ for his defense fund.  A punitive, not corrective, move."
"“Great news all around” says @CNN, on the SPECTACULAR economic news today. 304,000 jobs created, wages rising, record labor participation, confidence boom. No 2020 Dem could ever do better.  Period. @realDonaldTrump"
"Coming up on #IngrahamAngle—former fed agent who hunted sex traffickers & rescued victims; a wanna-be @HowardSchultz Slayer, and the latest in the @JussieSmollett case."
Trump nominated three phenomenal picks for the 9th Circuit. Conservative freak-out  followed false reporting of supposed cave to Dems. Chill!

Don't miss @ChrisChristie on The Ingraham Angle right now!! @FoxNews
"Also @AdamKinzinger lecturing @realDonaldTrump on foreign policy is a complete joke.  Our endless interventionism helped empower Iran, create ISIS, and devastate Middle East’s Christian communities."
Just now @AdamKinzinger casually tossing around possibility of U.S. military intervention in Venezuela.  These pols are never as excited abt enforcing our own rule of law and borders.

"Is it racist to ask students to speak English in school? Email your name, number and comment to ingraham.podcast@gmail.com, and we'll try to get you on my podcast!"
Hilarious to watch former Trump staffers who’ve just written a book that betrays confidences complain about other Trump staffers who allegedly leak to press.

"Trump's re-opening the gov't fostered such goodwill! Pelosi today asked ""...what does Putin have on the President, politically, personally or financially?"" #ShutdownFizzle"
Now @CNN Acosta claims a potential shutdown deal is “a bright shiny object” to distract from Stone indictment.  #Fool
OMG @CNN is acting like “ground-stops” are rare events in air travel!  Anyone who travels knows that LGA ground stops are not uncommon. The hype is pathetic.
Watching analysis of Stone arrest on TV — shocking lack of honest and objective analysis.  Even criminal defense lawyers making huge leaps of logic with rank speculation.
"The @FBI arrest of Roger Stone at dawn, with dozens of helmeted agents, brandishing weapons, was totally unnecessary.  Treated him like El Chapo.  Political motives clear w/ @CNN tip-off."
"""We're cleaning up John Kerry's mess."" - @SecPompeo on today's podcast. Stay tuned for the whole interview."
"Vets - what do you think of Nathan Phillips and the Covington kids? Email your name, number and comment right now ingraham.podcast@gmail.com and you can be on the show!"

"New Podcast tomorrow! Email your name, number and comment to ingraham.podcast@gmail.com if you want to be on the show! We will be discussing the effort to silence & intimidate conservatives, more fake news from @BuzzFeed and the NFL’s officiating debacle."
"Today @realDonaldTrump is offering a deal to the Dems that is better than many of them thought possible a year ago. If they dismiss it, they’ve ignored DACA folks and security."
"“Three good things only... deportation on honor violence murderers, mandated Swedish speaking ability and civic education about Sweden for passport eligibility, and 10k extra police on the street.”"
“None of the 72 political point this new Swedish coalition agreed on addressed the urgent issues that every Swede is worried about....”
“Violence and parallel societies in Sweden...it’s out of control and the coalition agreement gives the country back to the people who created the mess—yet no one voted for them.”
"From Swedish pal (who doesn’t like Trump): “Annie Loof, the centerparty leader is a zealot. The Sweden Dems and the two other right wing parties are in majority. The center party and liberal party who did this lost half their voters in 2 mos. It will get worse now.”"
"Every day the Dems and Republicans refuse to pass strong border security measures, is another day they’re putting American lives & the migrants lives at risk. Reprehensible."
"Until migrants know that they will be turned back at the border by a wall, or immed adjudication, or will not be allowed to work or get free stuff, they will keep coming."
"Danger to public health, burden on public schools and local budgets—not enough coverage of these ill-effects of massive border crush.  Media—take off your “Resist” buttons and do your jobs."
"Yes, @realDonaldTrump has ALREADY shown willingness to compromise—perhaps more details coming today...need to give something to get something."
"Trump needs to keep the pressure on—wall AND asylum reform, expedited turnbacks absolutely necessary. Dems are being exposed more every day as the party of open borders and lawlessness."
"Tune in for an #IngrahamAngle Special hosted by @davidwebbshow. And dude, lose the white privilege!"
"Women podcast listeners, your views on the softer more sensitive men pushed in the media, Hollywood and & advertisers today?  Join me on air now by emailing us at Ingraham.podcast@gmail.com #toxicmasculinity"

"For a president who the media claims is autocratic, @realDonaldTrump sure settled on an odd AG candidate—Barr is independent, brilliant and strong."
Love watching Democrats trying to trip up the consummate professional William Barr in his confirmation hearings.
Should flight attendants be tipped? And @HBO’s Sopranos anniversary gives us new nicknames. 10p ET @FoxNews.
Epic debate coming up on @FoxNews with @jorgeramosnews and me on border standoff. 10pm ET
"The cable ratings tell the story—@realdonaldTrump’s supporters want him to keep fighting for American safety & security.  Dems refuse to compromise—the president already has, acting in good faith."
Hmmm...why was it be a good idea to have @realDonaldTrump give an “off the record” immig briefing to news anchors who despise him? @potus comments already leaked.
Coming up -- The Christian baker who went all the way to the Supreme Court -- and won... because he refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple is back in court. He joins us EXCLUSIVELY to tell us why he's being punished this time. @FoxNews
"Trump believes in protecting American workers, American safety, American sovereignty.  Dems believe in resistance and obstruction.  Period."
Must’ve missed the media demanding “instant fact checks” on Obama Admin after Susan Rice was sent out on four Sunday shows to lie after Benghazi.
"Spectacular win by @ClemsonFB. Very impressive at every level—and they may just have a future Hall of Famer QB.  Stellar.  As for @AlabamaFTBL, next year!"
What if many Americans see that the country can still function quite well with a fed govt trimmed by 20-25 percent? The prospect terrifies Dems and Big Govt Republicans.
"The @federalreserve shd rule out rate hikes given fact that inflation risk zero.  Phenomenal Dec jobs numbers. Thank you, @realDonaldTrump."
"President @realDonaldTrump must NOT relent in his focus to protect American borders.  He stands for homeland security.  Pelosi stands for open borders, the safety of Americans be damned."
"Remember in 2016 @realDonaldTrump not only had to beat the Dems, but also the GOP Establ (Bushes, Romney, Ryan).  This dynamic is at play once again.  #predictable"
"Report today that another, far larger, caravan assembling in Honduras of as many as 15,000 people.  About 1,000 illegals released every week. Will Pelosi & Schumer do nothing? McConnell? Hello?"
Trump should come out vehemently against the wall...then Democrats would hold a presser supporting one.
"If a police officer had shot and killed an illegal alien the media would be doing hourly reports, noting the current “anti-migrant climate.”"
Has anyone asked Mattis if his resignation was requested by @realDonaldTrump? Is this a possibility given their policy differences?
Tune in LIVE Ingraham Angle 10p ET on the partial government shutdown hysteria.  @foxnews
"""Brian Kilmeade, 'Fox & Friends’ host: Donald Trump ‘refounded ISIS’ by withdrawing from Syria "" Remember: ISIS is a Sunni terror organization, detests Assad's Alawite regime, and Hezbollah and Iran, both of which are hated by ISIS as Shiite heretics. (from Patrick Buchanan)"
"""In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist."" -- Dwight D. Eisenhower"
Former Navy Secretary and former Asst Sec Def @JimWebbUSA would be someone to consider seriously for SecDef. His foreign policy views line up better with @realdonaldtrump and are not Bush 3.0.
Democrat Whiplash: Mattis’s resignation letter reads like it was written by Paul Wolfowitz and edited by Bill Kristol.  And Dems cheering!
"Socko show tonight. Shutdown-hype and SecDef Mattis bows out. Joined by @SteveScalise @GovMikeHuckabee @RepSeanDuffy @edhenry and the man behind the @gofundme campaign for ""the wall."""
McConnell should fight for the wall like he fought for Kavanaugh.
"Thank you to Rich, Mike and James...here’s to the next adventure!"
"After 17 1/2 years, 4 presidential elections, 3 adoptions, countless live shows from Iraq to Indiana, I hang up the radio headphones at noon today.  Thanks for being my extended family all these years.  Find me at @PodcastOne in January for something new."
It was supposed to be a “big beautiful wall” with a “big beautiful door.” Now it’s just an open door with no frame.  Unreal.  #BorderDisorder #GOPFail
Don't miss my exclusive interview with @DevinNunes right now on The Ingraham Angle! We'll discuss updates to the Michael Flynn case and more potential FBI abuses @FoxNews
"From @SecretaryCarson smashing back on my radio show at @NBCNews’s implication that Trump has nefarious motives in new “Opportunity Zone” regs: “The [Opportunity] Zones are picked by the governors, not Jared Kushner.”"
Nuestra Senora De Guadelupe! December 12th.  Feast Day of the Patron Saint of the Americas.
Claymation Congressman @ericswalwell just speculated that @realDonaldTrump’s tariffs against China are bc of business he has there. Trump’s favored tariffs as an enforcement tool for decades.) #pathetic
"Update: Patrick Bowe, 14, (Pelham, NY) has been found! No word on circumstances.  Thank goodness! Thank you all for your prayers."
Trump must not give ground to Pelosi and Schumer.  Trump's instincts earlier this year was to VETO the omnibus without getting the money for the border wall. #NoWallNoDeal
"Tune in tonight for a LIVE #IngrahamAngle on Comey’s hearing deficit, the best analysis of the Manafort/Cohen memos, and the Hart-less Oscars. 10p @foxnews"
The telltale sign of a bad Trump pick—someone who leaves the Admin. and proceeds to trash @potus. Tillerson was ill-suited for the job from Day One.
Bill Barr and Heather Nauert at DOJ & UN -- two phenomenal picks by @realDonaldTrump.
Former AG Bill Barr would be an excellent AG.  Ditto for @GovChristie.
"Listening to @CNN bemoaning the use of tariffs against China—how do THEY propose we respond to China’s proven cheating, dumping, IP theft & subsidies? With a “pretty please”?"
"Of course, China is demonizing @USTradeRep Lighthizer bc he's incredibly effective.  He has been on to the Chinese racket for decades. @realDonaldTrump must not relent, and not be moved by momentary dips in Dow. China plays long ball."
Join us on this breaking news night RIGHT NOW with @jasoninthehouse @VDHanson & @WisenbergSol  and later we will be joined by @RaymondArroyo @CLewandowski_ & more! @FoxNews

Using memorial services or funerals to launch political attacks--exactly the sort of crassness they accuse @realDonaldTrump of exhibiting--is always wrong.
