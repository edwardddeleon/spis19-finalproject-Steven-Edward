Luh uuuuu
Overhyped? I stated Dabin and Trevor would be performing live with me. Which is true. It can be exhausting for them to all play their own sets too though. The red rocks lineup is sick af.
Omggggg
Hahahaha. She is the fkn bestttt
Bangerrrrr
I’m saving most the stuff for the ascend tour but I’m playing a few new!
Oh and fractures edit. Forgot about that one!
- new ascend intro ✔️ - gorgeous vs all together edit (LAZERS) ✔️ - hold on edit ✔️ - say it edit v3 (psy) ✔️ - broken ones edit ✔️ - gtfa outro edit ✔️ (😓😓) - bunch of mashups (one that really fucks my emotions up) ✔️ ASCEND TOUR LEGOOOO 3 weekssss
Wow I want a refund
I bought urs bb
No hate but definitely didn’t play it more than once! ❤️
Cone of shammeeee
That’s the trouble with these arenas is the floor sells out super quick and then spikes up in price cuz of resellers and scalpers but the surrounding areas are still reasonable. :/
Floor sold out. Those are resellers/scalpers
🙏🙏
Bruh let’s play
Did u send a screenshot of the money being withdrawn to support? They may need some proof of that. I’m not sure I’ve never ran into this issue before.
Dude u hit up merch support??
Thank uuuu 🙏🙏
Well I’m sorry I came off that way! Honestly that meet and greet was kind of a reck because it set up a situation where I either took time to have conversations and then exclude tonsss of other people. Or just try to meet as many people as possible but be short. Lose lose :(
When did we meet? I have zero recollection of this. Like maybe I came off like a dick cuz I didn’t wanna party or something but I’ve definitely made a strong effort to never be a dick to fans.
Lmaoooo
Thank u for checking dude!! Hugely appreciated 🙏🙏❤️
Thank u homieeeee. So stoked for our tunneeee
You are the winner of the Phoenix Radio contest :) Hit up @Mike_ILLENIUM with your size + address and he will send the shirt and pin out. Thanks for listening ❤️

Blown away by all the kindness and support for the release of ascend this weekend. If you guys are digging it
Mmmm snugs
Love you so dude. Wouldn’t be here without you and am so grateful for ur guys continuing support. ❤️❤️

Only thing I ask u guys
Holy shit Sunday is almost over and ASCEND COMES OUT FRIDAY! I think it just actually hit me. Ahhhhh Frkn out. V v v v excite. LEGO!!

Don’t get used to it
Let’s fkn gooooo @G4TN7 @braydenkaai
Nope! That was an edit I made just for the new ascend show.
Hahahah ya like almost 3 years ago we were fucking around with it and I loveddd it but had no idea where the take the song. I showed a preview on my insta live helllaaaa long ago lmao. We should make something new.
@SaidTheSky @iamdabinlee whatchu got

@Fedmyster @G4TN7 dream team
Happy bday!!
See all the blue? Those are available tix no being re sold.
Ya those are re sellers tickets. Ticketmaster let’s people re sell thru their site.
I don’t have control over tickets being re sold at higher prices. This insane tix are for the floor and they sold out pretty fast and are now being re sold by scalpers. Unfortunately I can’t do much.
👋
no thank god
no jeff and i both decided we would exclude too many people if we did something too small and we couldnt get something large enough set up fast enough. we didnt have any sound or production to bring to a new venue. we tried tho.
Dunno where u heard this but this is incorrect. The weather destroyed the electronics at main stage
First ever b2b with @excision today. Let’s fkn get itttttt 🤘🤘🤘
I’m a v stubborn hooman
and then i wrote good things fall apart.
Let’s play Sunday
Hahahah since all my friends ditched me and play games I don’t like!! Literally all my best friends in a discord channel doing activities and shit and I’m left alone
jk bb luh u 4eva

Absolutely not
Need one more for Apex rn. Needs to be a strong carry. Lego. (PC player)
You are the winner! Hit up @Mike_ILLENIUM and he will send one out to you 🙂
You win one because that gif is awesome. Hit up @Mike_ILLENIUM and he will send one out. I’m still gonna choose one more person randomly.
I’ve sent ur msg along to the team and they will try and help u out.
I hate seeing stuff like this.  I’m sorry but I really don’t have control over every merch order. Ur guys support is everything to me but I have a separate team that runs everything and unfortunately things happen.  they do their best to make everyone happy. Sorry for the trouble
Ps shoutout to my amazing gf @LaraMcWhorter for her ninja photoshop skillz
She says pawssuppp space mom! 🐾
Cuz u didn’t invite me bitch
Ohhh yasssss. All welcome!

Sorry! Just been traveling and off social media a bit!
Omg say wut
I gotta save most of it al for the ascend show but I will play a couple unreleased tunes for sure!
Finally heading home after 2 weeks on the road! Submitting my album tmro and making edits all week! 😍😍🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️
Sounds fucking sicckkkk!!!
Down af after I finish dis albummmm!
Fuck yasss!!!!
Ur probably seeing vip tix
Keep scrolling down and u will see an “artist presale” link. The artist pre sale starts at 2 pm
Did u order via my website? I did it for myself and got mine but not sure why people aren’t getting there’s.
Dope! If not
It’s technically seated but I doubt many people are gonna actually be seated. Just saying there are multiple price points! ❤️
If you purchased online they should have asked for your cell number!
For what show? Where u see dis
Dopeeeee❤️❤️
I made my first edit for the ascend tour and it’s gonna be the first song the lazers are used for and I tried my best to make it sound like lazers. HOLY SHIT ITS CRAZY FAMMM. Getting more and more excited by the minute. 💥🔥😍
They saw us like 5 min later and came and said watsup hahah ❤️
Edc was 90 min
Someone from my team goes through the crowd and selects a certain somebody!
working for me?
NEVER!! just phase 1 fam. more dates announcing
Im creating a new show for the new album that may vary a bit night to night but Im not 100% sure yet honestly.  Anything with 'throwback set' in the title is extremely different tho.
just phase 1 fam <3
Okay so u only get the pre-sale code for one specific show
Good question I’m asking!
I got u guys. Audiotistic first tho!
So good hangin dude!!
If u don’t like the music I produce
It was the promoter!!
HAPPY BDAY KOREAN JESUS @iamdabinlee (this pretty much means today is Christmas)
