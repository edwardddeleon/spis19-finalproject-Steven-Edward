"Debido al fracaso del gobierno federal, 33, 000 techos todavía siguen con toldos azules después del huracán María, que fue hace casi 2 años. El gobierno federal debe proveer todos los recursos, por el tiempo que sea necesario, para preparar a nuestros conciudadanos para lo peor."
"Under the so-called ""War on Drugs,"" men on street corners dealing pot were thrown in jail. I want to see a war on the corporate greed that is killing Americans. I want to see top executives held personally liable for actions that led to the deaths of more than 42,000 people."
"Under my legislation, the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act, Johnson & Johnson would be fined $7.8 billion—13 times as much as this penalty, about half of the company's profits, and 10 percent of the total annual cost of the terrible opioid crisis afflicting our country."
"Over 40 years, income per person doubled. But half our people live paycheck to paycheck. Why?  Because the top 1% captured 45% of new income. And the median hourly wage grew by $2 over 40 years.  This is a rigged economy. And the working class needs to come together to fix it."
"Some say we can't afford tuition-free public college.   Let me get this straight: 40 years ago, in an economy with half the income per person, some of the best public schools were essentially free.   But guaranteeing college for all is so ""radical"" that we can't afford it today?"
"On the issue of guns, we are not so divided: Over 90% of the public supports universal background checks.    @SenateGOP and @realDonaldTrump: the country is demanding action right now. Will you side with the American people or will you just do what the @NRA wants?"
"El pueblo boricua se unió, se levantó, y le forzó a Rosselló a renunciar. Nos muestra lo que la gente común puede lograr cuando nos organizamos. Ahora tenemos que asegurar de que reciban una representación justa y receptiva. Puerto Rico se merece la democracia, no la austeridad."
Esto es inaceptable. El gobierno de los Estados Unidos le ha fallado al pueblo de Puerto Rico por demasiado tiempo. Eso debe acabar ya. El presidente Trump debe asegurar que el gobierno federal esté haciendo todo lo que esté en su poder para reconstruir a Puerto Rico.
"It makes no sense for young people to be denied jobs because they were arrested for smoking marijuana. It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
"Esta persona debe ayudar a la isla a recuperarse luego de décadas de devastación económica y del huracán María, que arrasó la isla hace casi dos años. Sin demora, garantizaremos el apoyo total del gobierno federal en la reconstrucción y recuperación de Puerto Rico."
"Felicito a los milliones de boricuas que se unieron a exigir que el gobernador Rosselló renunciara. Cuando nos unimos, no hay nada que no podemos lograr. La próxima persona que gobierne la isla debe escuchar a la gente y oponerse a la corrupción y la austeridad de Wall Street."
"His successor must stand against corruption and Wall Street-imposed austerity to help the island recover from decades of economic devastation and Hurricane Maria. Together, we will ensure the full support of the federal government in the rebuilding and recovery of Puerto Rico."
"Does Donald Trump want a war with Iran? Who knows? Nobody in the world knows what they'll do tomorrow. And given the confusion in this administration, it’s possible they may.   But this I do know: The United States Congress must do everything it can to prevent this war."
"Me uno al reclamo del pueblo boricua, que ha salido a la calle en un #ParoNacional, para exigir la renuncia inmediata del gobernador Ricardo Rosselló. Debemos garantizar el apoyo del gobierno federal en los esfuerzos de reconstrucción y recuperación de Puerto Rico."
"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, who have taken to the streets for a national strike, to demand the immediate resignation of Governor Rosselló. We must ensure the full support of the federal government in the rebuilding and recovery of Puerto Rico."
"Me uno al reclamo del pueblo boricua que salió a la calle a exigir la rendición de cuentas por parte del gobernador y el fin de la corrupción. Ante los huracanes y 10 años de austeridad, los boricuas tienen derecho a la democracia y a todo el apoyo federal para salir de la crisis"
#IStandWithIlhan and am proud to work with her in Congress.   Trump is stoking the most despicable and disturbing currents in our society. And that very hatred and racism fuels him. We must fight together to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country.
"We are having a ""milk toast,"" the finest beverage of the great state of Vermont."
"""A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold."" This was Justice John Paul Stevens’ prophetic dissent against Citizens United. During his tenure on the Supreme Court, he was astute and fair. We will miss him."
"One might have thought given all the Republicans in the House and Senate, a vast number would be standing up and saying the president's racist comments do not reflect the views of their party. It is sad and disappointing the degree to which Trump's ideology has dominated the GOP."
I must admit that today I felt the burn.
"I applaud the House of Representatives for voting to end all U.S. participation in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. Congress has the power to end this brutal, unconstitutional military intervention. I will do everything in my power in the Senate to see that it becomes law."
"We must stop family separation; reunite families that have been separated; end detention of families, children and anyone who doesn't pose a danger; eliminate private detention facilities; and protect asylum seekers. We also must oppose Trump's nightmarish mass-deportation plans."
Thank you. My condolences and thoughts are with you and your family. Your father is an example of what America is all about.
"El Congreso asignó fondos para asistencia nutricional de emergencia hace semanas. Mientras los puertorriqueños pasan hambre, @USDA, @SecretarySonny, @OMBPress, y @MickMulvaneyOMB mantienen esta ayuda en el limbo burocrático. ¡La administración debe proveer estos fondos ahora!"
We are saying that all public colleges and universities should be tuition-free and debt-free for ALL Americans.   All Americans are entitled to Social Security. All Americans are entitled to health care. All Americans are entitled to education as a right.
"During the financial crisis, Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in American history. Now it is Wall Street’s turn to help rebuild the disappearing middle class. #CancelStudentDebt"
"Nearly half of all college students are going hungry and the average college senior takes on $30,000 in debt.   But let's go beyond statistics. Share your personal story in a video or tweet, with the hashtag #CollegeForAll. And tell me what we should be doing to fix this crisis."
"Hoping for a full recovery for Red Sox great David ""Big Papi"" Ortiz, one of the most outstanding and popular baseball players in recent memory."
"75 years ago at Normandy, the United States and its allies led the largest land invasion in history to help free Europe from Nazi barbarism. We will never forget the young people who gave their lives. We honor them by working toward a world of freedom, dignity and peace for all."
LGBTQ people face unacceptable workplace discrimination and abuse. I say to the huge corporations rainbow-branding themselves for #PrideMonth:  Pay your employees fairly. Let them unionize. Support their right to health care.  Do not cheapen the struggle for dignity and freedom.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: It is outrageous that the Walton family makes more in one minute than a Walmart worker earns in a year. It is not radical to end taxpayer subsidies for this wealthy corporation and have it pay its employees a living wage of $15 an hour.
"While we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we must also remember our veterans. As the former Chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I believe we must strengthen the VA and guarantee that all veterans receive the quality health care they earned."
"Today, on this Memorial Day, we remember and honor all those men and women who gave their lives to defend our country, American values and our democracy. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten."
"It is obvious that the President is a pathological liar who does not understand the Constitution. The fact is that if Mr. Trump continues to disregard the right of Congress to subpoena, he will leave House Members with no choice but to begin an impeachment inquiry."
"We must not only make public colleges tuition-free, but we must substantially reduce student debt in this country. It is absolutely absurd that millions of Americans are paying off debts for decades because they got a higher education."
"I thank my colleagues @SenSherrodBrown, @SenBobCasey, @RonWyden, @SenatorBaldwin, @SenBlumenthal, @SenMarkey, @SenWarren, and @SenJeffMerkley for joining me in this effort to stand with workers and against the outrageous greed of Delta Air Lines."
"The Alabama Senate voted to outlaw nearly all abortions. These hypocrites decry ""big government,"" yet they want to control every aspect of women's bodies, private decisions, and futures.   Our job is to fight at every step to protect reproductive rights."

There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work. #WorldPressFreedomDay
"This is the beginning of a bipartisan process to take back our responsibility over these most important matters. My likeminded colleagues and I, in a bipartisan fashion, will utilize all of the legislative tools at our disposal—including further use of the War Powers Act."
"The bad news today: we were unable today to override Trump’s veto regarding U.S. intervention in this horrific war in Yemen. The good news: for the first time in 45 years, Congress used the War Powers Act to reassert its constitutional responsibility over the use of armed forces."
"Today, the Senate will vote on overriding Trump's veto of our bipartisan bill to end unlawful U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This is not about partisan politics. What’s at stake are millions of innocent lives and our Constitution. I urge my colleagues vote yes."
Attorney General Barr's handling of the Mueller report has been a disaster. This is what I feared and why I opposed his nomination. I look forward to Special Counsel Mueller's testimony and believe Congress must continue to investigate whether the president obstructed justice.
"Six trillion dollars have been spent on the so-called war on terror. That is an unbelievable amount of money. Do we really need to spend more than the next ten nations combined on the military, when our infrastructure is collapsing and young people can't afford to go to college?"
"Today is #EarthDay. Unless we take bold action to reverse climate change, future generations will look back and ask a very simple question: ""Where were they? Why didn’t the United States of America lead on preventing the devastating damage that scientists were sure would come?"""
"The House will vote soon on our resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Trump has said he opposes ""endless wars."" He can show us he means it by signing this resolution when it comes to his desk."
"The Senate Republican Budget:   - Throws 32 million off healthcare  - Cuts Medicare and Medicaid  - Kicks 175,000 kids off Head Start  - Denies nutrition assistance to 5 million pregnant moms and babies  - Provides more tax breaks to the Top 1%"
"While Trump provided a trillion dollar tax giveaway to the top 1% and profitable corporations, his budget would deny high-quality childcare and early childhood education to nearly 150,000 kids by cutting Head Start by $7.6 billion over the next ten years."
"16 years ago, the United States invaded Iraq. I opposed it at the time, warning of unintended consequences. We are still dealing with those disastrous consequences today and will be for many years. We need a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, not war."
"Yemen is experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster in the world due to the Saudi-led war.   The U.S. has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war. Too often, our weapons are being used to kill civilians.   Today, the Senate can take a major step toward ending this war."
"85,000 children have starved to death in Yemen as a result of the Saudi-led war.  U.S. participation in this war has not been authorized by Congress and is therefore unconstitutional.  Tomorrow the Senate will vote to end U.S. support for this disastrous and unconstitutional war."
"Medicaid covers nearly half of all births in the U.S.  But Donald Trump wants to cut Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.  Our job: Stop Trump's cruel budget and guarantee health care to every woman, man and child in this country, not throw more people off the health care they have."
We spend more on the military than the next 10 countries combined.   Now Trump is proposing an $861 billion increase in base defense spending over 10 years.   And he wants to pay for it by cutting over $1 trillion from programs working families depend on. That is a disgrace.
Trump's budget is breathtaking in its cruelty. It cuts:  - $1.5 trillion from Medicaid - $845 billion from Medicare - $25 billion from Social Security  This budget does the exact opposite of what Trump promised the American people.
"600,000 people, disproportionately people of color, were arrested for possession of marijuana in 2017.  It is time to decriminalize marijuana, expunge past marijuana convictions and end the failed war on drugs."
"Today’s House Oversight hearing with Michael Cohen confirms what we already knew: the president is a liar, a racist, and very likely a criminal."
"The people of Venezuela are enduring a serious humanitarian crisis. The Maduro government must put the needs of its people first, allow humanitarian aid into the country, and refrain from violence against protesters."
"Combined 2018 profit of Amazon, GM, Netflix & Goodyear: $24.5 billion  Federal income taxes paid: $0  Combined federal tax refund: $275 million  Our job: Repeal all of the Trump tax giveaways to the top 1 percent and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
"Why does Trump want to repeal the estate tax? Maybe because without it, a majority of the assets held by households worth $100 million or more would never be taxed.   We must reduce inequality, not make it worse. Our job is to increase the estate tax on billionaires like Trump."
"Artificial intelligence and robotics are positive creations of the human mind. They should be used to improve the lives of working people, not just to increase corporate profits.  Human beings must control technology, not the other way around."
"Before Social Security was created in 1932, about half of seniors lived in poverty.   Today, the senior poverty rate is just 8.8% and in 2016 Social Security lifted 22 million Americans out of poverty.   Our job is not to cut Social Security. Our job is to expand it."
Trump and his friends believe in voter suppression and billionaires buying elections.   We want: ✅ Automatic voter registration ✅ The overturn of Citizens United ✅ Election day as a national holiday    History is on our side. We will win this struggle.
"The current fight in DC is about more than a wall. It's about whether we are a nation of laws, where the president obeys the Constitution and democratic processes. The American people must inform Trump that we will not become an authoritarian nation."
"Donald Trump may not like it, but we are not an authoritarian country. We have a constitution and separation of powers. There is no ""national emergency,"" and Trump cannot build his wall without congressional approval."
"The American people, the Congress and the courts must show Trump what the Constitution and separation of powers is about. Trump cannot declare a ""national emergency"" whenever he wants, and spend money on his pet project. Not gonna happen!"
"There is not a ""national emergency"" with regard to the southern border. What President Trump is doing is unlawful and must be opposed vigorously in the courts and legislatively."
Today we remember the Parkland students and teachers who lost their lives.  Thank you to the young people who have courageously led the movement to end gun violence. With your leadership and the strong support of the American people we will pass commonsense gun safety legislation
Amazon made $16.8 billion in profits over the past two years but have paid ZERO in federal income taxes. In fact it got a $269 million tax refund.  Our job: Demand large corporations pay their fair share in taxes so that we can rebuild the disappearing middle class.
"I will vote against William Barr’s nomination. I cannot support someone for attorney general who will not make public the full Mueller report, who opposes a woman’s right to control her own body and who supports the failed war on drugs. Mr. Barr’s nomination must be defeated."
Donald Trump made $694 million in 2016. That means he stopped paying Social Security taxes 40 minutes into the year.  Meanwhile a middle-class worker paid Social Security taxes the entire year.  I say to Trump: pay your fair share. Let's scrap the cap and expand Social Security.
"It is not too much to demand that in our democracy, everyone 18 years of age should be automatically registered to vote. End of discussion."
We have got to end the embarrassment of being the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee paid leave. #FAMILYAct
"Our health care system today essentially says that if you happen to be poor, you are less deserving of getting care than a wealthy person. That is fundamentally immoral and that is not the kind of nation we should be."
"Too many seniors are living in desperate poverty, unable to afford their medicine or basic needs. Many Republicans want to cut Social Security benefits. That's wrong. We need to expand them. Tomorrow, I will be outlining my plan to do that."
What kind of economy allows for the top 0.00025% of the population to own more wealth than the bottom 150 million? A rigged economy.  That is why we demand that the very wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes.
"Today in 1922, researchers at the University of Toronto announced the discovery of insulin. They sold the patent for $1 so it would be available to all.  97 years later, Eli Lilly is charging ~$300 and Americans die because they can’t afford their medication. Outrageous."
"Our infrastructure is collapsing, our health care system is dysfunctional, our political system is corrupt and we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. And Trump spends most of his time talking about a wall. It's time for a real change."
"In the richest country in the world, our teachers should be the best-paid, not among the worst-paid. I stand with Denver teachers. We must invest in public education because our students and teachers deserve better. #DenverTeacherStrike"
"75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today."
"Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks.  Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes."
We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.
"Trump is worried about America becoming a ""socialist nation."" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country."
"What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour?"
"Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud!"
The U.S. is the most powerful economy on earth and we must lead the world in the fight against climate change. We can do that by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people.
"The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry—but ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system."
President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change.   I believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy.
"Trump's demonization of Latinos is racist, it’s wrong and it also happens to be factually inaccurate. Undocumented Latino immigrants commit fewer crimes in America than the general public."
I agree with the joint statement from the Virginia House and Senate Democrats. Very serious and credible allegations have been made by two women against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. He needs to resign.
Climate change is an existential disaster facing the entire world. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. A Green New Deal can save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
Millions of our people are working for starvation wages. Here is the simple truth. Nobody can raise a family or pay the rent on poverty wages of $8 or $9 an hour.  We are the wealthiest country in the world. We can do better. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"Yes, the economy is great—for the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income. Not for the nearly 80 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck."
"We have got to think big, not small. Canada guarantees free health care for all, Finland provides free tuition at public colleges, France provides generous retirement benefits. We are the wealthiest country on Earth. Why can't we do the same?"
"Tonight, Trump repeated some of the most extreme anti-women attacks coming from the far right. At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman’s right to choose, we must fight to make sure that every woman has the right to control her own body. #SOTU"
"If we are serious about transforming our country, rebuilding the middle class and reinvigorating our democracy: let us bring our people together to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. #SOTU"
"Trump said tonight, “We are born free, and we will stay free.”  I say to Trump: People are not truly free when they can’t afford health care, prescription drugs, or a place to live. People are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families. #SOTU"
Tonight Trump—who in less than two years in the White House has seen 5 aides either plead guilty or be convicted of criminal charges—claimed the strength of the economy was dependent on him being free from necessary oversight and investigations. The exact opposite is true. #SOTU
How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change? #SOTU
"Despite what President Trump says, it is not “a hot economy” when 43% of households can't afford to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone without going into debt. That is not a hot economy. #SOTU"
"Let me guess. President Trump tonight will talk about crimes committed by undocumented Latinos. Do you think he will mention the mass shootings done by white men, or the need for common sense gun safety legislation?"
Will Trump talk about climate change in his State of the Union address tonight?
"Today, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major nation, our child care system is dysfunctional, our teachers are underpaid and many public schools are struggling. We need to invest in our kids, not a wall with Mexico."
"Instead of wasting billions on a wall with Mexico, tax breaks for billionaires and a bloated military budget, we need to end childhood poverty, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, combat climate change and invest in our kids and seniors."
"Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of our country. 25 hedge fund managers earn twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers. One family (Kochs) spent $400 million to buy elections. That's why we need a political revolution."
Let's not kid ourselves. What we have today is a campaign finance system that amounts to legalized bribery.
"Remember when Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the rich would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families?  The reality: bonuses for average workers are up by just two cents an hour since Trump’s tax plan was signed into law. Two cents."
Every other major country has made the morally principled and financially responsible decision to make health care a right to all of their people. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short.
Gov. Northam should resign. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax should step in and begin a new day for Virginia.
"Trump’s withdrawal from the INF treaty is dangerous and irresponsible. We should strengthen these treaties, not end them. We should invest in our children, our seniors and our working families, not in an incredibly expensive arms race."
"The grotesque level of wealth inequality, from a moral, economic and political perspective, is the great challenge we face. We cannot have a vibrant democracy or a just economy when so few have so much, and so many have so little."
"Our infrastructure is collapsing. Teachers are underpaid. Veterans sleep on the streets. Families can't afford child care.  But, according to my Republican colleagues, one of our highest priorities must be to give hundreds of billions of dollars to a few billionaire families."
It is not just a coincidence that 46% of all new income is going to the top 1%. That is the result of an economy that is rigged in favor of the wealthy.
"Incredibly, Republican leaders in the Senate have introduced a bill to repeal the estate tax for the richest 1,700 families in America. That's absurd.  From a moral, economic and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little."
Our bill only applies to the richest 0.2% of Americans. It would establish a:  -45% tax on estate values $3.5M to $10M -50% tax on estate values $10M to $50M -55% tax on estate values over $50M -77% tax on estate values over $1 billion
"Somehow, we have billions of dollars available for more jails and incarceration, but we ""can't afford"" to provide kids with the college education they need to survive in modern America. That doesn't make any sense to me."
"When Yemenis see “Made in USA” on the bombs that are killing them, it tells them that the USA is responsible for this war.  This is not the message we should be sending to the world. Congress must end support for the catastrophic war in Yemen led by a despotic Saudi regime."
"After Trump shut down the government for 35 days the first bill Sen. McConnell introduced wasn't to provide back-pay to 1.2 million federal contractors.  It wasn't to guarantee health care or lower drug prices.  It was to repeal the estate tax for the 1,700 wealthiest families."
"If we think big, not small, we can end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality, guarantee health care for all, have a livable minimum wage and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. The struggle continues."
"While I do not support the BDS movement, we must defend every American’s constitutional right to peacefully engage in political activity. It is clear to me that S.1 would violate Americans’ First Amendment rights."
As a nation we have a choice: are we going to join every other major country and make health care a right? Or will we continue to allow insurance and pharma companies to make huge profits off of people's suffering?
I do not believe that men and women fought and died for our right to vote so that billionaires could buy elections. We must move to real campaign finance reform and public funding of elections.
"In the year 2019, no one in America, especially those working for profitable corporations with billionaire CEOs, should be living in poverty or struggling economically.  We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage—$15 an hour."
"Mr. President. 800,000 federal employees and their families are human beings, not your play things. Do not treat them with contempt and disrupt their lives. They have kids. They have needs. Do not shut down the government again."
"Our infrastructure is crumbling. Instead of building a wall on the Mexican border, we should create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, schools, airports and affordable housing."
"When an undocumented person commits a murder, Trump talks about it incessantly. When, in 2017,  a white guy like Stephen Paddock kills 58 people in Las Vegas and wounds 851, Trump has very little to say."
"Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we pledge to never forget the 6 million Jews murdered by Hitler. At a time of increased tribalism and  xenophobia, we must recommit ourselves to fight against all forms of bigotry and intolerance."
"Thank you air traffic controllers, flight attendants, federal workers and contract employees for standing up for your rights, holding rallies, organizing and sharing  heartbreaking stories over the past 35 days. You are the reason that the government shutdown finally ended."
"How pathetic. On Dec. 19, the Senate unanimously passed essentially the same legislation that we will vote on today. We are back to exactly where we started. Thank you, Mr. President, for shutting down the government and holding 800,000 federal employees hostage. All for nothing!"
"The Constitution and federal law bans indentured servitude. That means no worker, including federal employees, should be forced to work without getting paid. Trump's anti-worker government shutdown is an ugly attack on the working class of this country."
"But we must learn the lessons of the past and not be in the business of regime change or supporting coups—as we have in Chile, Guatemala, Brazil & the DR. The US has a long history of inappropriately intervening in Latin American nations; we must not go down that road again. 3/3"
"The United States should support the rule of law, fair elections and self-determination for the Venezuelan people. We must condemn the use of violence against unarmed protesters and the suppression of dissent. 2/3"
"The Maduro government has waged a violent crackdown on Venezuelan civil society, violated the constitution by dissolving the National Assembly and was re-elected last year in an election many observers said was fraudulent. The economy is a disaster and millions are migrating. 1/3"
"President Trump, you want to talk about a crisis? 7 million Americans have become uninsured since you took office. The uninsured rate is the highest in 5 years.  We must end the embarrassment of being the only major country not to guarantee health care for all. #MedicareForAll"
"Trump stated loudly and clearly: ""I am proud to shut down the government.""   Now, Mr. President, with 800,000 federal employees struggling to pay their bills, end the crisis you created. Pay federal employees. Open the government."
"If Trump were serious about protecting our national security, he would recognize that climate change is not a ""hoax"" and is already causing destruction and instability worldwide. The time for bold action is now."
The bad news: We have just 11 years to take bold steps to rapidly transform our energy system to sustainable energy if the planet is going to remain habitable.  The good news: We can revitalize our economy and create tens of millions of jobs in the process.
"Today, 46 years after Roe v. Wade, abortion is a right in name only for millions of women in America. Our job: do everything we can to protect and expand reproductive rights and access to abortion across the country."
"We must stop incarcerating millions of Americans and funding militarism, and end racism in the criminal justice system and in the voting booth. Our attention should be on lifting up all Americans."
"9 years ago the disastrous Citizens United decision opened the door for billionaires and corporate interests to buy our elections.  To restore our one person, one vote democracy, we must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and stop the slide to oligarchy."
"We have a president who is a racist.  Today we say to Trump: We aren't going back to more bigotry, discrimination and division. We're going forward."
"Dr. King's vision of ending the triple evils of racism, economic injustice and war is as important today as it was when Dr. King fought for those principles, and must motivate us in all of our work. #MLKDay"
"We must do more than just “honor and remember” Dr. King. We must be faithful to his revolutionary spirit, his call for a “radical revolution of values” and his incredible courage in taking on virtually the entire political and economic establishment of his time. #MLKDay"
"Trump is shutting down the government not just for his absurd wall. When you don't pay 800,000 federal workers you are destroying the concept of government in a democratic society, and moving to more privatization and corporate control over our lives."
"Interesting. Trump and Putin are not only billionaire, anti-democratic authoritarians but they deny the crisis of climate change and push fossil fuels. What's the connection?"
"It is not a radical idea to say that instead of throwing millions of Americans off of the health care they have, we must join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare for All system."
"""When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.” -Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Riverside Church, 1967"
Mr. President. Stop holding federal employees hostage and stop holding the young people in DACA hostage. End the federal shutdown and reinstate legal status for these young Americans. #NoWall
"Since Trump was elected, the five richest people in America have seen their wealth go up by over $100 billion.  Over the past year, wages for average workers are up by $9.11 a week after adjusting for inflation.  That is the economic reality under Trump."
"Instead of an austerity program for working families and the poor, we need austerity for billionaires and large multinational corporations."
"President Trump said that ""nobody has been better at the military"" than him.  So why is he keeping the government shut down and leaving 42,000 service members without paychecks for the first time in history?"
"The wealth gap between white Americans and African Americans has more than TRIPLED over the past 50 years.  Today, the median white family has almost 10 times as much wealth as the median black family.  We must fight for racial and economic justice for all."
"We must repeal the Trump tax breaks for the top 1% and large, profitable corporations. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create a sustainable economy, not make the very rich even richer."
"Maybe I’m the “radical” one, but I don’t think it's acceptable that the top 25 Wall Street hedge fund managers made over $15 billion in compensation in 2017—nearly double what all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America made last year."
"Over the past 40 years there has been an enormous transfer of income from the middle class to rich. Since 1979, the bottom 90% of Americans have seen their share of national income decline from 58% to just 46%—costing them nearly $11,000 per household."
"We need to change national priorities in this country. Instead of giving a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1 percent and large, profitable corporations, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour."
"On nearly every ""radical"" idea the American people are with us:  72% want to expand Social Security. 70% want Medicare for All. 65% want a jobs guarantee. 64% want to legalize marijuana. 60% want tuition-free public colleges. 58% want $15 min wage. 57% want to break up big banks."
"While labor productivity has more than doubled since the late 1960s, nearly half of all new income generated in the U.S. since 1993 has gone to the top 1 percent.  This is what we mean when we say the economy is rigged in favor of the wealthy."
"Think big, not small. It is not ""radical"" to demand that all Americans receive decent wages, guaranteed health care, quality education, affordable housing and a clean environment. We need a government that represents all of us, not just the 1%."
"We need a revolution in education. Teachers in LA should not be forced to strike for decent wages and smaller classes. All parents deserve high quality, affordable childcare.  Young people should not leave college deeply in debt. We must get our priorities right."
"Trump says the economy is ""booming."" It is—for the top 10 CEOs who saw their combined compensation soar by 60% in 2017.   For the average worker, however, real wages went up by just 1.2% over the past year.   The very rich get richer. Working families continue to struggle."
"The federal minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage. That is why I, along with many other members of Congress, will introduce legislation this week to raise that wage to $15 an hour. If you work 40 hours a week, you should not live in poverty."
"Mr. President. Do you want to know what a real ""national emergency"" is? The scientists tell us that if we don't combat climate change aggressively, the severe damage done to our country and planet will be irreversible. Now that's a ""crisis."""
Do Trump and his billionaire friends understand that many federal employees live paycheck to paycheck? They have kids to feed and mortgages to pay.    Mr. President. Grow up. End the shutdown you created. Pay federal employees.
"Today, the top 0.1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90%.    Uncontrolled greed cannot be the driving force behind our economy.    Our job: demand that all Americans have good paying jobs, health care, quality education, and a healthy environment."
"Today, the 3 wealthiest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our people, and income and wealth inequality is worse now than at any time since the 1920s. This is a moral outrage and bad economics. Not acceptable."
Things that are national emergencies: -30 million without health insurance -15 million children in poverty -Tens of thousands dying from opioids and gun violence -Climate change  Things that are not national emergencies: -Building a border wall to satisfy Fox News
"Last year, the five largest drug companies in America made nearly $60 billion in profits. The top five pharma CEOs made over $113 million in total compensation in 2017.  Meanwhile, 1 in 5 Americans can’t afford their prescriptions. That should outrage every member of Congress."
"Trump has told the American people several hundred times that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is a lie. If his wall were to be built, Mexico would not pay for it. American taxpayers would."
"Why do Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world?  Why are there no restrictions on what a drug company can charge?  The answer is simple: other than Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry is the most powerful political force in the country."
"There's no crisis at the border. President Trump, you want to talk about crises?   -30 million Americans have no health insurance -Climate change threatens our planet -Half of older Americans have no retirement savings -40 million are dealing with outrageous student debt"
"We do not need to waste billions on an unneeded wall so that Trump can appease right-wing extremists.  We need to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure — roads, bridges, water systems, rail and affordable housing."
"As a result of Trump's shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are in danger of not receiving a paycheck.  They're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, feed their families and put gas in their cars.  Unbelievably, Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to take action."
"Jimmy Carter was right when he said that America is ""an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery.""  Every day we are sliding further away from democracy into an oligarchic form of government.   Democracy should be about one person, one vote—not billionaires buying elections."
"As a result of Trump's government shutdown, many federal employees will be unable to pay their mortgages or feed their kids. The Senate's first act must be to re-open the government.    Leader McConnell: Let the Senate vote on the House bills to re-open the government."
"If President Trump is really concerned about national security then why isn't he paying employees at the FBI, TSA and other security agencies who work every day to protect this country?   President Trump. End your shutdown of the government. Pay federal employees."
"President Trump, federal employees are not billionaires. They have to feed their kids and pay their mortgages. End the shutdown now and treat federal employees with the respect they are due."
"Congratulations to Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins for understanding that 800,000 federal employees must be paid. If Leader McConnell allows the Senate to vote, we can end the government shut down now."
"Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, yesterday attacked ""the fraud of socialism."" Really? I wasn't aware that it was ""socialism"" that lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and got us into a horrific war that we should never have started."
"Is it ""radical"" to demand that all Americans have health care, that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes, that workers earn at least $15 an hour and that we transform our energy system in order to combat climate change? I don't think so."
"At a time when climate change threatens our planet, when our infrastructure is crumbling, when 30 million people have no health insurance, I'm concerned that the concept of PAYGO will make it harder for Congress to address the many crises facing our working families."
"Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments."
"Our job: pursue a bold agenda that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.   We're at war with climate change and, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, we cannot lose."
We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly.
"As 2018 comes to an end, Jane and I want to wish all of you a happy New Year's Eve and a healthy and wonderful new year."
"The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, and then spends billions denying its responsibility.  We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
One of the great crises facing our democracy is power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored when the very rich and their Super PACs buy elections. We need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.
"If it is just ""bi-partisan politics"" to spend some $700 billion a year on the military, more than the next ten nations combined, why is it a ""radical"" idea to lower student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free?"
"The extraordinary power of the corporate establishment is not just over our economy and political life, it is over our imagination and our ability to envision a different kind of world."
"The American people are tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us. They want policies which work for all, not just the wealthy few."
"As we enter the new year let us not forget that while the very rich become much richer, millions of Americans are unable to afford health care, housing, prescription drugs or education. In 2019 we can do better. We must do better."
"There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed."
"The six largest banks now have over $10 trillion in assets—54% of GDP. We must break up these huge financial institutions. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist."
"As we celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace - and economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season.
"While Trump talks about a ""booming economy,"" the reality for working families is: -Real wages for average workers are lower than in 1973 -80% live paycheck to paycheck -Half of older Americans have no retirement savings New Year’s Resolution: Create an economy that works for all."
"Wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 3 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom half of our country, while over 40% cannot afford the basics to live."
"This is what Christmas season looks like in Trumpland: -Take away paychecks of 800,000 workers by shutting the government. -Take away $1.40 meals from 755,000 hungry, unemployed Americans. - Give Pfizer a $26.5 billion tax cut after it increased the price of life saving drugs."
"Think about it for a minute.  Democrats and Republicans come together, after a whole lot of debate, and agree on how to keep the government open.  And then, after a day of right-wing media criticism, the president undermines all of that. To say the least, that is problematic."
"If Trump shuts the federal government down, should federal employees be available to escort him to his beachfront resort in Florida for a 16-day holiday? I don’t think so!"
"This is what happened:  1) The Senate unanimously voted to keep the government open 2) The House was ready to pass the bill 3) Rush and Fox & Friends criticized Trump 4) Trump now wants to shut down the government, putting 800,000 people out of work the week before Christmas"
"Last Tuesday, Trump said “I’m proud to shut down the government.” And he did. Despite unanimous Republican support in the Senate and overwhelming Republican support in the House, Trump will leave 800,000 federal employees without paychecks. How’s that for a holiday gift?"
Nearly half of American adults have had an immediate family member incarcerated at some point. HALF.  Imagine what we could accomplish if we invested in jobs and education instead of paying $80 billion a year to lock up 2.2 million people.
"Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.  What's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need."
"I'm glad the First Step Act passed. But there is much more needed to achieve comprehensive criminal justice reform. We must:  -End cash bail -End private prisons -End mandatory minimums -Reinstate the federal parole system  Our primary goal must be rehabilitation, not punishment."
"Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the wealthy would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families.  He lied. Bonuses are up $0.02/hr since the GOP tax cuts passed.  Our job: Repeal Trump’s tax breaks for the wealthy and rebuild the disappearing middle class."
U.S. student loan debt outstanding reached a record $1.465 trillion last month.  You know the most revolting part of this crisis?  The federal government makes billions in profits off of student loans each year.
"I want to thank my colleagues and the many people at the grassroots level who helped us pass this historic resolution. Today, 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act, the U.S. Senate finally used that authority for the first time."
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen has resulted in the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. That crisis is 85,000 children starving to death; 10,000 new cases of cholera every single week; and the United Nations telling us that Yemen is on the verge of imminent famine."
"Let us show the world today that the U.S. Senate recognizes that real American power does not come from our ability to blow things up, but from our ability to bring people together.  We must finally end US support for the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen."
Today the U.S. Senate will vote on whether to end US support for the devastating Saudi-led war in Yemen.   This would be the first time ever that the Senate has voted to end an unauthorized war.   We must finally end US involvement in this humanitarian and strategic disaster.
Tomorrow I'll move to proceed to the resolution I've offered with @SenMikeLee and @ChrisMurphyCT to end US involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am optimistic that a bipartisan coalition will vote to make clear we will no longer support Saudi Arabia in its destructive war.
Thankfully there is a way to make sure that nobody has to delay or cancel the care they need because they can't afford it. #MedicareForAll
"There is virtually unanimous agreement in Congress that the murder of Jamal Khashoggi must be addressed. I look forward to supporting my colleagues’ additional legislative proposals at the appropriate time, but right now I am focused on securing an up or down vote on S.J.Res. 54."
"I look forward to an up-or-down vote next week to end U.S involvement in the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen. I am confident that we have the bipartisan votes to pass the War Powers resolution in the Senate, which would be an historic step forward."
"12 million people in Yemen are suffering from severe hunger and 85,000 kids have already died from starvation as a result of the Saudi-led war.  The United States should not be supporting Saudi Arabia in this disastrous war. The U.S. Senate must vote to end our involvement."
"Our job is to be bold. Our job is to think very big and to go forward in a moral struggle that says: we will protect our planet, not just for our own children but for all the children of the world. #ClimateTownHall"
"Think for a moment—that instead of spending well over a trillion dollars on weapons of destruction, we could be spending that money on transforming our energy system and protecting the planet. #ClimateTownHall"
Americans living with HIV/AIDS should not have to suffer because they can’t afford the outrageous prices charged for medicine they need to live.  Our job is to bring down the cost of prescription drugs and make health care a right for all. #WorldAIDSDay
President George H.W. Bush served our country honorably. He and Barbara will be remembered for their humble and devoted service to the country they loved. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to the entire Bush family.
"A renegotiated NAFTA must stop the outsourcing of U.S. jobs, end the race to the bottom, protect the environment and lower the outrageously high price of prescription drugs.   Trump’s NAFTA 2.0 does not meet these standards and I will strongly oppose it in its current form."
"Do not forget: it was a U.S. bomb that killed 40 children on a school bus in Yemen in August—some of the many thousands of civilians who have died in this horrific, Saudi-led war.  The Senate must vote today to end our support for these atrocities."
The United States should not be supporting a catastrophic war led by a despotic regime with a dangerous and irresponsible military policy.   The Senate must vote to end U.S. support for the unconstitutional Saudi-led war in Yemen.
"At a time when voting rights are under grave attack, there is absolutely no place on the federal bench for Thomas Farr, who both authored and defended tactics designed to suppress minority voters. I strongly oppose his nomination."
"85,000 children have starved to death during the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.  The U.S. should not be part of Saudi Arabia's destructive foreign policy. Congress must end our participation in that war now, and help provide immediate humanitarian aid there to save lives."
"We must do everything we can to protect our trans brothers and sisters from violence, and we will work every day until hatred and discrimination truly have no place in our society. #TDOR"
Trump is clearly very afraid of the prospect of the Senate delivering a serious rebuke to his policy by voting to end U.S. support for the Yemen war. But that is exactly what we will do when we vote on SJ Res 54 next week.
"Trump also blamed Iran for the disastrous war in Yemen, despite the fact that the Saudi-led coalition has caused the most destruction by far."
"Today President Trump, in a rambling and dishonest statement, tried to defend the despotic Saudi regime and cast doubt on the CIA’s conclusion that the crown prince was personally involved in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi."
"At a time of massive corporate profits, and an already regressive tax system, Amazon and other large corporations do not need corporate welfare. Instead, they need to pay their fair share of taxes."
"It is grossly unfair for millions of workers in this country to be earning starvation wages, while the companies they work for make billions in profits and pay their CEOs outrageously high compensation packages."
The bill I'm introducing today would prohibit large corporations from buying back stock unless they:  -Pay all employees at least $15/hr -Allow employees to earn up to 7 days of paid sick leave -Ensure CEO compensation is not more than 150x median employee pay  #StopWALMART
"The Walton family of Walmart is the wealthiest family in America, worth $180 billion. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s horrendously low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion every year."
"While Walmart claims it cannot afford to pay its workers $15 an hour, it was able to find enough money to pay its CEO more than $22 million last year.  Tomorrow @RepRoKhanna and I will be introducing The Stop WALMART Act to put an end to their outrageous greed."
Here is the simple truth:  We have a president who is a racist. A president who is a sexist. A president who is a homophobe. A president who is a xenophobe. And a president who is a religious bigot.  We have got to confront that truth and reject Trump's bigotry.
"The Walton family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans.  Meanwhile 55% of Walmart’s associates are food insecure.  This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy, and why I'm introducing a bill tomorrow to make Walmart start paying a living wage."
"Trump describes the free media as an ""enemy of the people""; attacks leaders of democratic countries while cozying up to authoritarian nations; and now uses his influence to try to stop the counting of votes in FL and GA.  There is only one way to describe him: Authoritarian."
"Last year, 4 members of the Walton family of Walmart made $12.7 billion in 1 day.  It would take a full-time Walmart worker making $11/hr over 653,000 years to make that much.  Thursday, @RepRoKhanna and I are introducing legislation to make Walmart pay its workers a living wage."
"While we set aside this day to recognize their service, we must commit ourselves to keep America’s promise to our veterans, just as they kept their promise to us."
"Today, in addition to commemorating Veterans Day, we also recognize the centennial of Armistice Day and the end of World War I, a war in which many Vermonters bravely served and lost their lives."
"On days like this we are reminded of the sacrifices made by all those women and men who have worn the uniform in defense of our nation. We owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude, which we will never truly be able to repay."
In the first week of the new Congress I will be re-introducing my legislation to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour. We have got to end starvation wages in the richest country in the world.
"Further, at a time when too many Americans are harboring homicidal and/or suicidal thoughts, we must greatly improve access to mental health counseling."
"Congress and President Trump must finally have the courage to stand up to the NRA, and do what the American people want – pass common sense gun safety legislation."
"There is no magical or simple solution to the epidemic of gun violence in our country. The mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, tells us, however, that we must do everything possible to stop these never-ending tragedies."
"Congress must pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, demand that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the probe based on his previous statements and only confirm a new attorney general who vows to protect Mueller's investigation."
Today we observe #LatinaEqualPay Day because Latina women still make only 53 cents on the dollar compared to white men. It should not be a radical idea to address that issue of basic equality.
"The Republican agenda is clear:  1) Take health care away from 32 million Americans 2) Give huge tax cuts to billionaires and large, profitable corporations 3) Slash Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security 4) Allow the planet to be destroyed"
"A worker making the federal minimum wage needs to work 99 hours a week, 52 weeks a year just to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment   That is a national disgrace."
"The wealth of the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, increased more than 9,000% since 1982.  Walmart still doesn’t pay their workers a living wage.  This is what a rigged economy is all about."
"If this country stands for anything it has got to stand for the right of people to practice their religion, to live their lives without bigotry, without fear and certainly within their houses of worship."
"In this country we battle with words and ideas, not fists and bombs.     Acts of violence, appeals to violence and condoning violence have no place in American society."
"The news about bombing attempts against President Obama, Secretary Clinton, George Soros, CNN, various Democratic officials and others is gravely disturbing. While many more details will come to light, these deeply un-American acts of violence have no place in our democracy."
Congratulations to United Catering Operations workers for winning your union election with @unitehere! Now it’s time to bargain your first contract. Keep fighting and winning! #EqualityatUnited
"By attacking the media and condoning violent behavior toward journalists, Trump is giving a green light to authoritarians all over the world to endanger the lives of those who work for a free press."
"We cannot have an ally who murders a dissident in cold blood, in their own consulate. That is unacceptable by any government, but especially by one so closely aligned with the United States."
"Of the many issues with Trump, his movement to an authoritarian type society here in American and his support for authoritarians around the world should be of concern to every American who believes in democracy."
"If your plan to get elected is to suppress as many minority voters, young voters, and voters with disabilities as possible, it's pretty clear you shouldn't be in politics in the first place."
4 Republican policies led to a $779 billion deficit in 2018:  - Bush Tax Cuts: $488 B - Trump Tax Cuts: $164 B - Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: $127 B - Defense increases since 9/11: $156 B  Without tax cuts for the wealthy and endless wars we would've had a $156 billion SURPLUS.
"Next month, I plan to give the Senate another chance to vote on my resolution to end our support for the war in Yemen, to reassert Congressional authority over matters of war, and to show the Saudis that they do not have a blank check to continue human rights violations."
The Saudi-led war in Yemen has become the world's largest humanitarian disaster. The recent disappearance and likely assassination of Jamal Khashoggi only underscores how urgent it has become for the United States to redefine our relationship with Saudi Arabia.
"In Georgia, in order to try to win the election, cowardly Republicans are blatantly suppressing the vote and denying many African Americans the right to vote. Every American, no matter their political view, must vigorously protest this outrageous action."
Election Day must become a national holiday. In America we should be celebrating our democracy and doing everything possible to make it easier for people to participate in the political process.
Authoritarians seek power by promoting division and hatred. We will promote unity and inclusion. #SandersSAIS
Our job is to make sure that we commit more resources to taking care of people than we do on weapons designed to kill them. #SandersSAIS
"The world spends a total of $1.7 trillion a year on the military.  The cost to end poverty is $175 billion per year for 20 years, about 10% of what the world spends on weapons.  Donald Trump thinks we should spend more on these weapons. I want to spend less. #SandersSAIS"
"Our job is to rally the entire planet to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, which continues to make huge profits while their carbon emissions destroy the planet for our children and grandchildren. #SandersSAIS"

"If it is true that the Saudi regime murdered Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist critic, in their own consulate, there must be accountability, and an unequivocal condemnation by the United States. #SandersSAIS"
There’s no question that authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the president of the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy shatters democratic norms and attacks the independent media and judiciary. #SandersSAIS

The disgrace of what has taken place with Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination will not be lost on the American people. We are mobilized from coast to coast.
Judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of joining the Supreme Court.  - He will become a part of the hard-right majority on the Supreme Court - There are very credible allegations of sexual assault against him - He lied to Congress
Let me say this to all the survivors out there: I hear you. I believe you. Thank you for speaking out.
"Trump’s remarks last night were unusually horrendous.   Dr. Ford has received death threats. Nazis have protested outside her house. Last week, she was forced to publicly answer questions about an experience so painful it still haunts her.  And Trump's response was to mock her."
"The 4 largest banks in this country (JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo) are on average 80% larger today than they were before we bailed them out.  If these banks were too big to fail 10 years ago, what would happen if any of them were to fail today?"
"I want to congratulate Jeff Bezos for doing exactly the right thing by raising the minimum wage at Amazon and Whole Foods to $15 an hour.  Let me thank the hundreds of Amazon workers who contacted my office and the Fight for $15 movement, which has been leading this effort."
One year ago 58 people were killed and 800 injured by a gunman in Las Vegas. My thoughts are with those victims' families today. We have got to prevent more innocent Americans from becoming victims of gun violence by passing commonsense gun safety legislation.
"Kavanaugh claimed that he and Dr. Ford “did not travel in the same social circles.” Dr. Ford said she dated Chris Garrett, referenced as a friend in his yearbook. In fact she testified Garrett introduced her to Kavanaugh. (9/x)"
Judge Kavanaugh testified he treated women “as friends and equals” and “with dignity and respect.” Numerous entries in his school yearbook would seem to contradict this. Was Judge Kavanaugh’s statement to the committee truthful? (8/x)
"Kavanaugh repeatedly told the committee he never drank to the point where he didn’t remember something. He also denied ever becoming aggressive when he drinks. There have been many reports from Kavanaugh's high school, college and law school classmates that contradict this. (7/x)"
"Kavanaugh testified before the committee that he did not believe polygraphs were reliable. In 2016 he wrote, “The Government has satisfactorily explained how polygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes.” What changed his opinion or was he misleading the committee? (6/x)"
"In 2006 Judge Kavanaugh testified, “I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.” New evidence released as part of these confirmation hearing contradicts that assertion. (5/x)"
In 2004 Judge Kavanaugh testified the nomination of William Pryor to the 11th Circuit “was not one that I worked on personally.” Documents now contradict that statement. (4/x)
In 2006 Kavanaugh told Congress he didn't know anything about the NSA warrantless wiretapping program prior to it being reported by the NYT. This year an email revealed that while at the White House he might have been involved in some conversations about this program. (3/x)
Kavanaugh was asked more than 100 times if he knew about files stolen by Republican staffers from Judiciary Committee Democrats. He said he knew nothing. Newly released emails show that these files were regularly shared with Kavanaugh while he was on the WH staff. (2/x)
The FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh must include a review of his numerous untruthful statements in his previous testimony before Congress. Lying to Congress is a federal crime.   Here are his statements that appear to not be true: (1/x)
"If @ChuckGrassley and Senate Republicans are concerned a thorough FBI investigation would delay this confirmation process, remember that you refused to allow the Senate to consider Merrick Garland’s nomination for nearly a year."
A man who uses the same hostile and aggressive tactics as Donald Trump when faced with credible allegations of sexual assault does not deserve a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
"I listened to Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I believe Dr. Ford.   Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on the Supreme Court.  If Judge Kavanaugh wants to clear his name of these serious charges he should demand an FBI investigation. If not, the Senate must reject his nomination."
"Today we need to remember: Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the others who have come forward have done so with incredible courage, fully knowing that their character would be attacked and terrible things said about them. Their lives will never be the same. We owe them our respect."
Trump and Judge Kavanaugh have two options. Trump can withdraw Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Or Kavanaugh himself can call for an FBI investigation if he truly believes the allegations are false.
For far too many people it's too difficult to get to the polls. We need to make it much easier for everyone to participate in the democratic process. Election Day should be a national holiday.
"Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have risked their lives to come forward and tell their stories. Republican Senators, their staff and the Trump administration must stop disparaging these brave women and treat them with respect."
"If Brett Kavanaugh refuses to withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court following these two very serious allegations of sexual assault, then the Senate Judiciary Committee must postpone any votes on his nomination until a full and fair investigation is conducted."
"One year since #HurricaneMaria, the people of Puerto Rico are still suffering. We must use the full resources of the US government to not only help the island recover, but to go forward and create a strong, sustainable economy and energy system."
40% of fast-food workers have reported experiencing sexual harassment. That is simply unacceptable.   We must stand with the brave McDonald’s workers walking out today to demand the company address this epidemic of sexual harassment.
"Yesterday the President of the United States lied about the deaths of thousands of American citizens for his own personal gain.  Mr. President, try working with the people of Puerto Rico for a change, not against them."
"We are not going to let Social Security be destroyed. Today, 18 senators and 140 House members are founding the Expand Social Security Caucus to make sure seniors can retire in dignity.  Hear that, Paul Ryan?"
"Today while we remember the lives lost on 9/11, we must also honor the courageous men and women who continue to serve and die in Afghanistan, Iraq and many other places, and consider whether these wars—the longest in our history—have made us safer."
"We must not only work to end terrorist violence. We must fight the conditions that give rise to it: corruption, authoritarianism, inequality and ethnic and religious hatred."
"If this is the wealthiest country on Earth, why are one in five American adults skipping medical care because they can't afford it?  Answer: our health care system is built to make corporate profits — not give people the care they need. #MedicareForAll"
"Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and many brave people who risked their lives that day to help. Those acts of selfless sacrifice speak to the very best of us as a nation—we are a people prepared to come together and work for the good of our fellow Americans."
"If we are bold, if we have the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry, if we are prepared to invest in sustainable energy, we can make the necessary changes to save the planet. And that’s exactly what we have to do. #RiseForClimate"
"The issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It's about the ""new economy"" and the degradation of the human spirit—breaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies."
"Our job now is to energize people, revitalize American democracy and fight for a government that will work for all of us, and not the wealthy few."
"This week we have seen more and more evidence of President Trump’s dangerous disregard for the democratic norms of our country, and stunning revelations about his erratic and misguided policy decisions and his pathological lying. We live in dangerous and unprecedented times."
Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is a dire threat to:  -Abortion rights -Campaign finance reform -Voting rights -Workers' rights -Health care -Climate change -Environmental protection -Gun safety  He cannot be given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
Let's be clear: the government has a moral responsibility to provide for the vulnerable. But taxpayers should not have to expend huge sums of money subsidizing profitable corporations owned by some of the wealthiest people in the country and the world.
"If employers in this country simply paid workers a living wage, taxpayers would save about $150 billion a year on federal assistance programs and millions of workers would be able to live in dignity and security."
"President Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime. We should not confirm his Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a man who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed."
"What is the Trump administration trying to hide about Brett Kavanaugh? If Republicans believe he deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, they must stop hiding his records and release all of his documents."
"The trade union movement has led the fight for equal rights and economic and social justice. Today, Labor Day, we reflect on those struggles, and pledge our support to protecting workers’ rights and building an economy based on human needs, not corporate greed."
"The median Amazon employee makes $13.67 an hour.  Many of those employees rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing to survive.  You know who pays for that? You do.  You know what Jeff Bezos makes every hour? $10,833,33  It's time for Amazon to get off corporate welfare."
"Amazon’s warehouses are one of the most dangerous places to work in the U.S. According to the NCOSH, seven Amazon workers have died on or near the job since 2013. I will be asking OSHA to investigate unsafe working conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers."
"Just 3% of Brett Kavanaugh's records have been released. If Republicans believe Kavanaugh deserves a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, why are they afraid to show the American people what Kavanaugh has written?"
"Billionaires shouldn't be on welfare. If the owners of large, profitable corporations won't pay workers a living wage, then we are going to tax them for 100% of the public assistance benefits their workers are forced to rely on."
"John McCain was an American hero, a man of decency and honor and a friend of mine. He will be missed not just in the U.S. Senate but by all Americans who respect integrity and independence. Jane and I send our deepest condolences to his family."
"Betsy DeVos has a brilliant idea. While paltry school budgets deny kids a decent education, she may let states use federal funds to buy guns for educators—not books, computers or pay raises. Guns. Meanwhile the Trump administration opposes all commonsense gun safety legislation."
"At a time when Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in a crime, we shouldn’t confirm a Supreme Court justice picked by Trump, who believes the president cannot be indicted or deposed. The Senate must postpone Kavanaugh’s hearings until the ongoing investigations are complete."
Americans deserve to know the truth about the 2016 election. Any attempt by the president to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation or pardon Cohen or Manafort would be a very serious offense.
President Trump's associates who have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of serious crimes – so far:  - His campaign chairman - His deputy campaign chairman - His lawyer - His national security advisor - His foreign policy advisors
"11) So, the question that must be asked is why would the corporate media would put their blind faith in a far right-wing economist whose past reports have been so thoroughly discredited by mainstream economists and experts?"
3) What Tapper and others have done is say we're wrong because Blahous didn't actually intend to find that Medicare for All would be a great deal for Americans. The problem is: Blahous did find it would save $2 trillion – he just doesn't like that people are celebrating it.
...Any score that replaces Medicare reimbursement rates with some other set of rates is not a score of our plan.
"2) Tapper says, “The study’s author says that that $2 trillion drop is not actually his conclusion. He says that’s based on assumptions by Senator Sanders.” Wrong. Provider payment rates in our plan are not assumptions, they are written into the bill..."
"This is how our rigged system works:  1) Republicans give huge tax breaks to their wealthy campaign contributors  2) Billionaires spend millions to elect Republicans  3) Republicans push cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid to make the rich richer and everyone else poorer"
"Remember: our ""crazy idea"" of universal health care is a reality in:  Australia Austria Belgium Canada Chile Czech Rep. Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Israel Italy Japan Netherlands New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal S. Korea Spain Sweden Switz. Turkey U.K."
"A year ago, countless people were injured protesting white supremacy and Neo-Naziism in Charlottesville and and one person, Heather Heyer, was killed. Today, we honor Heather, and all who stood up to hate, by recommitting ourselves to fighting all forms of racism and bigotry."
"Maybe, just maybe, we should make sure our people are not dying because they lack health insurance before we start spending billions to militarize outer space. #SpaceForce"
"Despite Trump’s tax giveaway to the wealthy and large corporations, real wages have actually gone down, not up, since June 2017. The economy may be the best in history for billionaires like Jeff Bezos, but it is not ""booming"" for the average worker."
"What insurance company CEOs made in 2017: -Leonard Schleifer (Regeneron): $95.3 million -Dave Wichmann (UnitedHealth): $83.2 million -Mark Bertolini (Aetna): $58.7 million  We need a system that provides health care for all, not massive compensation for a few CEOs.#MedicareForAll"
"If every major country on Earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita, please don't tell me that the United States cannot do the same."
"I can't believe we have to say this in the year 2018: Poverty is not a crime.  Hundreds of thousands of Americans, convicted of nothing, should not be in jail because they can't afford their bail."
"Does anyone really believe Trump is concerned with human rights in Iran, when he’s had only kind things to say about authoritarians around the world, including Putin in Russia, Kim Jong Un in North Korea, Duterte in the Philippines and Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia?"
"Thank you to the young people leading the fight to put people over profits and transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. When we stand together, we can overcome the power of the fossil fuel industry. #ThisIsZeroHour #YouthClimateMarch"
"Today we mark the 100th birthday of Nelson Mandela, who led the struggle to end the horrible apartheid system in South Africa. Let his courage and commitment to equality and justice serve as an example to all of us as we work to create a better world."
"5) And finally, the Congress must make it clear to President Trump that his job is to protect the values that millions of Americans struggled, fought and died to defend: democracy, justice and equality."
"4) The Congress must make it clear that we will not accept any interference with the ongoing investigation of Special Counsel Mueller, such as the offer of preemptive pardons or the firing of Rod Rosenstein, and that the president must cooperate with this investigation."
3) The Congress must demand that the sanctions against Russia that were passed last year be fully implemented.
"2) The Congress must move aggressively to protect our election systems from interference by Russia or any foreign power, and work closely with our democratic partners around the world to do the same."
1) The Congress must make it clear that we accept the assessment of our intelligence community with regard to Russian election meddling in our country and in other democracies.
"If President Trump won't confront Putin about interference in our elections and his destabilizing policies, Congress must act. Tweets and speeches are fine, but we need more from Republican senators now.  Congress must take these 5 actions to rein in Trump's dangerous behavior:"
"McDonald’s gave its CEO a 42% raise last year, while it reneged on a commitment it made to pay at least $1 an hour above the local minimum wage to its low wage workers. #CEOsvsWorkers"
"Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, made more than $22 million in compensation lsat year—or almost $11,000 an hour. #CEOsvsWorkers"
The Walton Family of Walmart owns more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans. Meanwhile 55% of Walmart’s associates are food insecure. #CEOsvsWorkers
"Jeff Bezo’s newly renovated home in Washington DC will have 25 bathrooms. Meanwhile, Amazon workers skip bathroom breaks in order to meet their grueling work targets. #CEOsvsWorkers"
"Last year, Amazon reported nearly $5.6 billion in U.S. profits and did not pay a penny of federal income taxes on it. #CEOsvsWorkers"
"How does it happen that there are many major corporations in America where CEOs receive extravagant compensation packages, who pay their workers wages so low that many of them are forced to rely on food stamps to survive?  #CEOsvsWorkers"
While Disney’s CEO makes up to $423 million: - 1 in 10 Disneyland workers have been homeless in the past 2 years - More than 2 in 3 are food insecure - 3 in 4 don’t make enough money to afford basic needs  That is simply not acceptable. #CEOsvsWorkers
The average cashier at McDonald's would have to work for 895 years to make what the company's CEO makes in one year. #CEOsvsWorkers
Today is a good day for Putin and the oligarchs in Russia. It is a bad day for people in the United States and all over the world who believe in democracy and who are trying to understand what world our idiot president lives in.
Millions of Americans have risked their lives to defend our democracy. What would those brave men and women think if they saw President Trump's pathetic performance today?
Will Jeff Bezos have the guts to face Amazon workers at our town hall tonight at 7 pm ET and explain why he's worth $151 billion but won't pay them a living wage?
"President Trump’s press conference with Putin was an embarrassing spectacle. Rather than make clear that interference in our elections is unacceptable, Trump instead accepted Putin’s denials and cast doubt on the conclusions of our intelligence community. This is not normal."
Last year American Airlines made $1.9 billion in profits. Its CEO Doug Parker is on track to make $31 million this year.  They need to explain why 27% of workers at their subsidiary Envoy Air said they must accept food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet.
"Universal health care in America is not a radical idea anymore, thanks to the millions who have spoken out to demand a just health care system. 63% of American voters now support a Medicare-for-all health care system."
"Walmart’s CEO Doug McMillon made about $11,000/hour in compensation last year. I'd like to hear from him why he thinks his workers don't deserve to be paid a living wage of $15/hour."
"The Walton family, the owners of Wal-Mart, is the wealthiest family in America. Middle class taxpayers should not have to subsidize Walmart’s low wages to the tune of at least $6.2 billion each and every year. That's absurd."
"I'd like McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook to explain why the company had enough money to reward its wealthy shareholders with $7.7 billion in stock buybacks, but reneged on a commitment it made to its low-wage workers to pay them at least $1-an-hour above the local minimum wage."
"The Trump administration declaring the war on poverty “largely over"" is a callous attempt to justify their efforts to make massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security disability, education and affordable housing, while they give huge tax breaks to billionaires."
Does Disney CEO Bob Iger have a good explanation for why he is being compensated more than $400 million while workers at Disneyland are homeless and relying on food stamps to feed their families?
"""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel."" –Jeff Bezos, worth $147 billion  Mr. Bezos, here's another idea. Pay your workers enough so that thousands of them no longer have to rely on food stamps."
"Over and over again, Donald Trump tells us the U.S. economy is “absolutely booming.” Then why have wages gone down, not up, by 5 cents an hour since June of last year after adjusting for inflation?"
"President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be a rubber-stamp for an extreme, right-wing agenda pushed by corporations and billionaires. We must mobilize the American people to defeat Trump’s right-wing, reactionary nominee."
"If you are serious about this issue, tell your Republican pals in Congress to pass bills requiring Medicare to negotiate drug prices and enabling the importation of safe, low-cost drugs from Canada and other countries. (2/2)"
"Ed Schultz was a passionate defender of American workers and strongly supported trade policies that work for all, not just large corporations. For many years his voice has been strong, steady & against forces of corporate greed. Ed was a friend of mine and will be sorely missed."
I will do everything possible to see that the next EPA administrator actually believes in environmental protection.
"Instead of protecting our environment and combating climate change, Pruitt has worked to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and polluters all over the country. His resignation is a positive step forward for our country."
"The United States must lead the world in transforming our energy system by moving aggressively to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. When we do that, we protect the planet, create jobs and save consumers money."
"We must not be about forcing over 10 million undocumented people, many of whom have been here for decades, to continue living in fear and anxiety. Congress must do what the American people want. Let us create a humane and rational immigration system."
"That will mean restructuring the agencies that enforce our immigration laws, including ICE. We must not be about tearing small children away from their families. We must not be about deporting DREAMers, young people who have lived in this country virtually their entire lives."
"In 2002 I voted against the creation of DHS and the establishment of ICE. That was the right vote. Now, it is time to do what Americans overwhelmingly want: abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform."
Have you worked a minimum wage fast food job? What is it like to try to support yourself or your family? Do you have access to benefits or career opportunities?
Thank you to the thousands of people turning out today to protest Trump's cruel policy of separating families. The United States of America must never be about tearing apart families or locking up children in cages. #FamiliesBelongTogether
There can be no free society without a free media. The work of journalists in this country is absolutely essential to our communities and to a free and functioning democracy. Journalists should never have to fear for their lives as they do their work.
"When it comes time to decide on a replacement for Justice Kennedy, I hope that my Republican colleagues who believe that women, not the government, have the right to control their bodies will stand with those of us who oppose any nominee who would deny women the right to choose."
"While today’s ruling is a major setback for working families, we must redouble our efforts to make it easier, not harder, to join a union. We cannot rebuild the disappearing middle class without revitalizing the trade union movement."
"What the Kochs and other billionaires understand is that if they can destroy the trade union movement in America, it will be even more difficult for workers to earn decent wages and benefits, and the political power of working people will be diminished."
"America loses when we become divided by religion, race, national origin or sexual orientation. We are stronger when we come together."
"Trump's pathological dishonesty is undermining our democracy, setting a terrible example for our children and isolating us from our democratic allies around the world.  Now is the time for the American people to fight back on every front."
"Trump tells us every day how much he hates immigrants and how much he loves American workers. But last year, Trump chose to hire only one American worker even though thousands of Americans wanted to work at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The rest were low-wage temporary guest workers."
"What a hypocrite! @realDonaldTrump makes hateful and racist rants every day about how immigrants are “bad” for the country, but he had no problem hiring undocumented immigrants to help him build the Trump Hotel in DC or Trump Tower in New York City."
"Trump's political strategy:  1) Give tax breaks to billionaires, throw millions off health insurance, cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid 2) Blame immigrants (or blacks, Muslims, gays, Jews) as the cause of all problems  This is the kind of hate politics demagogues always use"
"I am hopeful that, as we have seen with other racist and xenophobic Trump policies, the courts will step in to rein in these unlawful actions."
"When you have the most powerful nation on earth saying that it is acceptable to tear children from the arms of their parents, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities. That is a very dangerous signal."
"To be politically successful, Trump needs to create enemies and divide us up. He needs to turn men against women, white against black, straight against the LGBT community, Christian against Muslim, native born against immigrant. We will not let him win."
We cannot spend more on our military than the next 10 nations combined while millions of Americans do not have food and housing and health care. It’s about time we got our national priorities right. That is why I voted against spending $716 billion on the military today.
"This is America, a nation of compassion and generosity. We will not allow Trump, Sessions or anyone else to continue a policy of ripping babies from the arms of their mothers. Together, we will defeat this inhumane and un-American action."
"The Trump admin, in its unabashed cruelty, is carving out a unique place in American history. It's not just support for racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and religious bigotry. They've hit a new low by separating kids from their parents and placing them in detention centers."
"The Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of separating children, including infants as young as one year old, from their parents at the border is inhumane, cruel and an affront to our values as Americans."
"Two years after 49 people were killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, it is a national tragedy that we have not done a single thing to prevent another mass shooting. We must pass gun safety legislation now. My thoughts are with those who are remembering their loved ones today."
"While very light on substance, Trump and Kim Jong Un's meeting is a positive step in de-escalating tensions and addressing the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Congress has a key role to play in making sure this is a meaningful process, not just a series of photo ops."
"Since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies have paid nearly $3 billion in fines or related settlements for fraud or misconduct. Yet, those three companies alone received about $800 billion in defense contracts over the past 18 years."
"Over and over again, Republicans say we cannot possibly afford to make health care a right through a Medicare-for-all program.  But when it comes to spending $716 billion on the military, all of a sudden there's deafening silence from my Republican colleagues about the deficit."
"I find it very strange that President Trump has such a hard time getting along with the leaders of the world's major democracies but feels very comfortable with despots and authoritarian leaders like Putin, Xi Jinping, Duterte and Mohammad Bin Salman."
"In their never-ending quest to throw millions off health insurance and raise premiums, the Trump Administration is now arguing in court that it should be legal for insurance companies to discriminate against the 130 million people with pre-existing conditions. That is a disgrace."
"Employee-owned companies won't provide starvation wages to workers and huge compensation packages to CEOs. They will not shut down and send their own jobs to China. In fact, study after study has shown that employee ownership increases employment, sales and wages."
"Instead of giving huge tax breaks to corporations who shut down in the United States and send jobs abroad to low-wage countries, we must invest in creating worker-owned companies."
"We all hope that the summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un is successful. Getting rid of North Korea's nuclear weapons through a credible process would be a major step forward for world peace. But when Trump praises Kim as “very honorable,” he makes a mockery of American values."
I believe that we have become far too comfortable with the United States engaging in military interventions all over the world. We need to ask this very hard question: is a perpetual war necessary to keep us safe?
"If we were a poor country, it would be reasonable to question whether we can achieve universal health care.  But we are not. We're the richest country in the history of the world. We can and must make health care a right to all."
We have to decide as a nation whether information about what we do with our lives should be sold to companies that will exploit that information.
"It costs $30,000 to send a California student to UCLA for a year. To send someone to prison, it costs $75,000.  We need to be a nation that invests in jobs and education, not jails and incarceration."
"This is what a rigged economy looks like: Working 100 hours in a week, not getting paid and actually owing the company a check.  Port truck drivers in this country deserve justice!"
"I strongly support imposing penalties on countries like China, Russia, South Korea and Vietnam to stop illegal dumping of steel and aluminum. But it makes no sense to start a trade war with Canada, the EU and others who are engaged in fair trade and pay workers a living wage."
"Trump’s haphazard and reckless plan to impose tariffs on Canada and the European Union is an absolute disaster that will cause unnecessary economic pain to farmers, manufacturers and consumers in Vermont and around the country."
I have a feeling ABC will not be asking on its nightly news program tonight how Disney can make $9 billion in profits while three-quarters of Disneyland employees can’t afford basic living expenses.
"Memorial Day is a time to pay special tribute to service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice and to honor and support their families. We should be united in commemorating the sacrifices of those who gave, as Lincoln said, “the last full measure of devotion” to our country."
"Our job: Increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour, create up to 15 million good jobs rebuilding America, expand Social Security, enact Medicare for all, and make it easier for workers to join unions."
"When Trump tells us the economy is ""booming,"" please remember: - Over 40% of Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency expense - 43% can't afford the basics to live - Over 25% of adults skipped necessary medical care last year because they couldn't afford it"
"With the apparent cancellation of the summit, the Trump administration should now commit itself to working with our allies in Asia and the international community on a genuine diplomatic strategy to remove the threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons."
"I am concerned that despite some very good provisions in the VA MISSION Act, it continues a trend toward the slow, steady privatization of the VA. I will vote against it."
"At a time of exploding profits, I would hope that @Amazon would pay everyone who works in your fulfillment centers a living wage. Thank you very much for your invitation to visit a fulfillment center. I look forward to doing that. Let’s work out a mutually convenient time."
"In Vermont, Planned Parenthood is the only provider of Title X services, and without federal funding, their ability to serve thousands of low-income Vermonters will be seriously limited."
"I always find it curious that ""conservatives"" tell us how much they want to get the government off the backs of the people. But when it comes to women and family planning, they want to the government to tell every woman in America what she can and cannot do with her body."
"The American people, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, overwhelmingly support common sense gun safety legislation. It's time to act."
It is not a radical idea to say that every American citizen over the age of 18 should be automatically registered to vote.
The Senate just took an important step toward reversing the Trump administration’s disastrous decision to repeal #NetNeutrality. Now the House must side with the 86% of Americans who support net neutrality and pass this resolution to protect our free speech and democracy.
"Up to 20% of incarcerated people in America are imprisoned because they lack the money to pay cash bail or fines for minor violations.   Let me say that again. Some 400,000 people are incarcerated today for crimes they haven't been convicted of. That is insane."
We need to stop imprisoning people for smoking marijuana and start prosecuting the crooks on Wall Street whose greed and illegal behavior caused the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.
"The United States must play an aggressive role in bringing Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and the international community together to address Gaza’s humanitarian crisis and stop this escalating violence."
"Over 50 killed in Gaza today and 2,000 wounded, on top of the 41 killed and more than 9,000 wounded over the past weeks. This is a staggering toll. Hamas violence does not justify Israel firing on unarmed protesters."
"If we're going to reverse the 40-year decline of the middle class and reduce the widening gap between the super-rich and everyone else, we must restore the constitutional right of workers to collectively bargain for a better life."
"Unlike Trump, Congress must take real action to lower the price of prescription drugs. That means passing legislation requiring Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and allowing the reimportation of safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other countries."
"The president made clear today that he will not keep the promises he made during the campaign to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. Instead, he has become a supporter of the pharmaceutical industry's extraordinary greed."
We need a new CIA director who is committed to the rule of law and will heed the advice of U.S. military leaders who vigorously oppose torture and uphold the values that have made us a great and respected nation. Ms. Haspel is the wrong choice to lead the CIA.
"In America today, if an employee is engaged in a union organizing campaign, that employee has a one in five chance of getting fired. That is unacceptable and that has got to change."
"If we're serious about reducing income inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we must increase the number of union jobs in this country."
"Real American power is not shown by our ability to blow things up, but by our ability to forge international consensus around shared problems. That is what the Iran agreement did.  Today President Trump put us on a very different, more dangerous path."
President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal is the latest in a series of reckless decisions that move our country closer to conflict.
"We should have the best educated population on Earth, not the most incarcerated population."
"Every day we must strive for a just and moral economy with decent wages, decent benefits and decent working conditions for all workers. That is a struggle that must be carried on by every generation. #MayDay"
"And we need a secretary of state who will address the crisis of climate change, not stymie action on one of the world’s most serious security threats.   For all these reasons, Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice to serve as the United States’ top diplomat"
"We need a secretary of state who will stand up for people of all faiths, sexual orientations and genders, not someone like Pompeo who opposes women’s rights and LGBTQ rights and who promotes religious bigotry."
"I voted against Pompeo because we need a secretary of state who'll check Trump’s bellicose nature, not encourage it. After 15+ years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, we need someone who will bring nations together in diplomatic efforts, not someone who supports never-ending wars."
"Our job is to strengthen the VA in order to provide high-quality care to our veterans, not dismantle it."
"On this #EarthDay let's commit to build a sustainable energy future and a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. That is our moral responsibility."
Congratulations to the students who are standing up and speaking out today in the #NationalSchoolWalkout. Your leadership will move us forward. It's long past time for Congress to take action on gun safety to save innocent lives.
"Barbara Bush will be remembered as a strong, independently minded and popular First Lady who was devoted to her family and her country. Jane and I send our condolences to the Bush family."
We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations. It's time to repeal the Trump tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class. #TaxDay
"While some drug companies have made billions each year in profits, not one of them has been held fully accountable for its role in an epidemic that is killing tens of thousands of Americans every year. That has got to change."
"If the Postal Service is going to be a vibrant entity, we must end this Bush-era mandate. We must also allow the Postal Service to raise new revenue by offering innovative new services that the American people need, including basic banking services."
The main reason for the financial problems at the Postal Service stems from a 2006 mandate forcing it to pre-fund 75-years of retiree health benefits to employees who haven’t been born yet. No other business or government agency is burdened with such an absurd requirement.
"Trade is a good thing, but it must be fair. Instead of rejoining the TPP, we must fundamentally rewrite our failed trade policies in order to raise living standards for American workers and workers throughout the world."
American workers should not be forced into a race to the bottom. They should not have to compete against manufacturing workers in Vietnam who make as little as 72 cents an hour.
"Today on Yom HaShoah we remember the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and recommit ourselves to the fight against anti-Semitism, bigotry and intolerance."
This is an issue that impacts virtually every American. The American people have a right to know how companies are profiting from our information.
"This nation needs a serious conversation about the proper role of these companies. Should Facebook, Google and Amazon be allowed to control so much of the internet? How do ordinary citizens benefit from the internet without seeing an invasion of their personal lives?"
"Companies today know every aspect of a person’s life—where they go, what they do, their medical and financial records, whom they talk to, what they buy—and use that information to make billions in profit."
"While the internet has been an enormous source for good, all that convenience and connection comes with a price. Our privacy has been invaded in an unprecedented way and in a manner that would have been unthinkable even 20 years ago."
"Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the Senate is a good first step, but nowhere near enough. Today’s hearing must be the beginning, not the end, of the discussion about the dramatic impact Facebook, technology companies and the internet at large play in our society."
It's not a radical idea to say that women should get equal pay for equal work and the same economic opportunities as men. This is an issue of basic justice. #EqualPayDay
Pompeo supports the use of torture. He has longstanding relationships with anti-Muslim extremists. And his hawkish views on Iran and North Korea could very well lead us into another disastrous war. I will vote no on his nomination.
"Mike Pompeo is absolutely the wrong choice for secretary of state. He is a supporter of the Global Gag Rule. He opposes LGBTQ rights. And as the top recipient of money from the Koch brothers, he's stymied action on one of our most serious security threats: global climate change."
"Republicans are already using the huge increase in the debt that they caused as an excuse to make major cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That is unacceptable."
We are not living in a poor nation. We are living in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. How do we have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty of any major country? How could it be that we don't guarantee health care to all people? We must demand change.
Let us never forget that at the time of his death Martin Luther King was organizing a multi-racial Poor People's Campaign and that he was assassinated in Memphis as he supported sanitation workers who were on strike for better wages and working conditions.
I'll join civil rights and labor leaders tomorrow in Memphis to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. Dr. King was not only one of the great civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He was also at the forefront of the fight for economic justice.
"Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains a humanitarian disaster. The U.S. must play a more positive role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all."
The killing of Palestinian demonstrators by Israeli forces in Gaza is tragic. It is the right of all people to protest for a better future without a violent response.
"How absurd is it that we live in a country where Congress and many states give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, but fail to provide adequate funding for education?"
"“Young people, you have it in you to shout. It is up to you not to keep quiet. Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?” – Pope Francis"
"Transgender people have served and continue to serve our country honorably in the military. Unfortunately, this administration is not treating them honorably. The struggle for equality for all Americans continues, and Trump's efforts to divide us will not succeed."
"And after providing a massive tax break for the wealthy that will blow a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit, Trump complains about the domestic spending initiatives secured by the Democratic Caucus to address the needs of working families and the middle class."
"After rescinding the DACA program in September and opposing every piece of legislation to help the Dreamers, Trump blames Democrats for a problem that he created."
John Bolton was part of the effort to mislead the US into the disastrous Iraq war and has supported military action against North Korea and Iran. He was too extreme to be confirmed as UN ambassador in 2005 and is absolutely the wrong person to be national security advisor now.
"The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, with U.S. support, has been a humanitarian disaster. Instead of supplying bombs and refueling capabilities, we should be doing everything possible to create a peaceful resolution to that civil war and provide humanitarian help."
"I'm deeply disappointed that Congress again abdicated its constitutional duty to authorize war. Over and over, Congress has sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as administrations have misled us into conflicts, including Vietnam and Iraq, with disastrous consequences."
6 months after Hurricane Maria we are still seeing a humanitarian crisis with schools being closed and people struggling to get clean drinking water. 1 in 10 people in Puerto Rico still have no electricity – in the wealthiest nation on earth. That is a disgrace.
"The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse."
"LBJ’s administration misled Congress and the American people into the Vietnam War, just as the Bush administration misled us into the Iraq War.   Time and again we see disasters when leaders refuse to tell the truth and when Congress is not actively involved in finding the truth."
The American people were lied to and misled by the Bush administration into believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11. And Congress did not challenge them on those claims the way it should have.
Let me give you two reasons why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority over war: the war in Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both wars Congress sat back and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations led us into conflicts with disastrous consequences.
"So far as a result of the Saudi-led war in Yemen: -Over 10,000 civilians have been killed -Over 3 million have been displaced -15 million people lack access to clean water and sanitation -More than 1 million cases of cholera have been reported"
"I expect that colleagues today will be arguing that we are not really engaged in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Well, tell that to the people of Yemen, whose homes and lives are being destroyed by weapons marked “Made in the USA,"" dropped by planes refueled by the U.S. military."
"The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts to Congress, the branch most accountable to the people. For far too long Congress, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has abdicated its Constitutional role in authorizing war."
It’s not good enough to just be against Trump. We have to have a vision for this country of where we’re going to go. #InequalityTownHall
"Since the 1990s, the financial sector has spent over $3.2 billion on campaign contributions, and last year alone spent over $200 million on lobbying. #InequalityTownHall"
I say to those in the mainstream media: start turning your attention to the millions of people who are in poverty and struggling every day. #InequalityTownHall
One of the hardest things that has to happen now is for ordinary people to stand up and say: this is United States of America and the pain that we're seeing should not be happening. #InequalityTownHall
"Poverty is a death sentence. About 130,000 Americans die each and every year from poverty. #InequalityTownHall"
This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And yet over 40 million Americans are living in poverty and we now have the highest childhood poverty rate of nearly any major country on Earth. #InequalityTownHall
What does our system of inequality mean to you and your family? #InequalityTownHall
"Since 2001, over 50,000 factories have been shut down in America. #InequalityTownHall"
"In 1979, the top one-tenth of 1% owned about 7% of our nation’s wealth. Today they own nearly 23%. #InequalityTownHall"
Tonight we're going to look at why the middle class has been in decline for 30 years while oligarchy is on the rise. #InequalityTownHall
"I was proud to have worked with Rep. Louise Slaughter during my 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Throughout her career, Louise was a leading figure in the fight for economic, social and racial justice. She will be missed by her constituents and the entire country."
"Today on #InternationalWomensDay—and every day—we must commit to building a country and world where all women are safe, have equal opportunity and the social, racial and economic justice they deserve. We will not go backward on women's rights. We will move forward."
"Charles Koch to Paul Ryan: Here's $500K for giving me a massive tax cut at working families' expense.  Also Charles Koch: “When large companies can pressure politicians to force everyday Americans to fork over unearned millions, we should all question the fairness of the system.”"
